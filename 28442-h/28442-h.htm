<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>
<h3>THE SPY ALARM</h3>
</div>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a German on the ground! Get
him!&#8221;</p>
<p>The sun glistened on scores of polished bayonets,
as sturdy figures, clad in olive drab, which
matched in hue the brown of the earth, sprang
from their trenches and rushed forward.</p>
<p>&#8220;Put some pep into it! Lively now! Get the
Germans!&#8221;</p>
<p>There were dull thuds, and there was a ripping,
tearing sound as the steel slashed its way through
the tough cloth. Along the swaying line rushed
the young soldiers, stabbing to right and left as
they went.</p>
<p>Now their weapons were directed downward
with deadly force, and they sank them into the
forms on the ground with such energy that the
earth beneath was torn and gashed, and the muzzles
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_2' name='page_2'></a>2</span>
of the guns, to which the stabbing bayonets
were attached, made deep impressions on the
yielding forms.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a German on the ground! Get him!&#8221;</p>
<p>Again the cry rang out, and again the rushing,
charging line surged forward, and then there followed
once more the thuds which told of the cold
steel going through and through and&#8211;&#8211;</p>
<p>Then from the center of one of the charging
lines there came a laugh as a lad, having driven his
keen weapon home with too much force, being
unable to free it, raised on his gun a large sack
stuffed with hay, the fodder bristling out of one
of the gashes he had made.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the stuff, Chunky! Go to it!&#8221; yelled
his laughing comrades. &#8220;If you can&#8217;t get a German
any other way, stick him on the end of your
bayonet, bring him back to camp, and feed him to
death!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Silence in the ranks!&#8221; cried the sergeant who
was drilling the young soldiers of Camp Dixton
in bayonet practice. For this is what it was, and
not a charge on some Hun position; though from
the fervor with which the boys went at it, and the
fierce commands of their officers, a person hearing,
and not seeing, might be inclined to believe
that it was actual warfare.</p>
<p>And it was, as nearly as it could be approximated,
for the sacks stuffed with hay or other
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_3' name='page_3'></a>3</span>
yielding material, suspended on framework as is
a football dummy or scattered over the ground,
were called &#8220;Germans,&#8221; by the drilling officers.</p>
<p>And, at the command: &#8220;There&#8217;s a German on
the ground! Get him!&#8221; it was the part of the
prospective soldier to rush at the recumbent sack
and stab it through and through with all his might,
trying to put into the stroke all the force he would
put into a similar one when he should attack the
enemy.</p>
<p>&#8220;You got your man all right, Chunky!&#8221; observed
a tall, bronzed lad, standing next to the
stout youth who had used his bayonet with such
force that he carried off one of the sacks as a
trophy. &#8220;You must be feeling pretty strong today.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, let up, can&#8217;t you, Jerry?&#8221; begged the
badgered one. &#8220;The ground was soft under that
sack, and I didn&#8217;t think the steel would go through
so far.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, do that when you get on the firing line
in France and it will be all right,&#8221; commented another
lad, on the opposite side of the one addressed
as Chunky. &#8220;I wonder how much longer
we&#8217;re going to keep this up?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;As you were!&#8221; came the sudden order, fairly
barked out from an instructing sergeant, and the
boys in the particular squad which included Ned,
Bob and Jerry, of whom more later, resumed the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_4' name='page_4'></a>4</span>
positions they had been in before the order to
charge bayonets had been given.</p>
<p>Chunky, or Bob Baker, to give his proper name,
managed to get rid of the encumbering sack on
his weapon, and marched back with the others.
They lined up at attention and waited for the
usual instruction and correction that followed each
charge, or other army practice.</p>
<p>&#8220;That was pretty good, boys,&#8221; said the sergeant,
as he glanced down the line, &#8220;but I&#8217;m sure
you can do better. A few of you were a bit slow.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now sometimes it&#8217;s all right to be slow, if
you have plenty of time, but in this business of
bayoneting Germans you won&#8217;t have much time to
spare, as you&#8217;ll find when you get on the other
side, which I hope will be soon.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was a murmur to this same effect from
all in the line.</p>
<p>&#8220;When you&#8217;re using your bayonet, use it first,
or the other chap may get ahead of you and&mdash;well,
you know what will happen then,&#8221; went on
the sergeant significantly. &#8220;And when you pull
your weapons out, do it this way,&#8221; and, taking a
gun from the hands of Jerry Hopkins, the sergeant
illustrated what he meant, using one of the
filled sacks as an enemy.</p>
<p>&#8220;There wouldn&#8217;t be much left of a German to
send home after <i>he</i> got through with him,&#8221; commented
Ned Slade, as the sergeant handed Jerry
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_5' name='page_5'></a>5</span>
back the gun. &#8220;He surely has some poetry of
motion&mdash;Sergeant Black has.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the way I tried to do it,&#8221; said Bob, to
his chums, Ned and Jerry. &#8220;Only&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Only you must have been thinking you were
going to leave your gun and bayonet sticking in
the ground to mark the place, so you could find
it the next time,&#8221; interrupted Jerry with a laugh.
For, the command &#8220;At Ease,&#8221; having been given,
the prospective soldiers were allowed to rest and
indulge in talk. The sergeant was called to one
side, while a lieutenant gave him some orders
about further practice and instruction.</p>
<p>&#8220;Aw, cut it out!&#8221; begged Chunky. &#8220;Guess you
forget the time you slept through first call, and
had to do kitchen police for two days.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Indeed I don&#8217;t forget it!&#8221; laughed Jerry. &#8220;It
isn&#8217;t a thing you can forget so easily. But let it
go at that. Only it did look funny, Chunky, and
you&#8217;d have said so yourself if you had seen it&mdash;it
certainly did look funny to see you rushing along
with the sack on the end of your gun.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Didn&#8217;t you feel the weight of it?&#8221; asked Ned
Slade.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Chunky&#8217;s getting so strong, since he has
his three square meals a day, regular, that he
doesn&#8217;t mind a little extra weight,&#8221; commented
another lad who stood in line near the three
chums.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_6' name='page_6'></a>6</span></p>
<p>The drilling sergeant turned to his men again,
and once more sent them through the bayonet
charge. Then came other drills of various sorts,
designed to make the young soldiers sturdy and
strong, to fit them for the strenuous times that
loomed ahead in France&mdash;times to try men&#8217;s souls
and bodies. But to these times the lads looked
forward eagerly, anxious for the days to come
when they could go &#8220;over there.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Whew!&#8221; whispered Bob to Jerry and Ned,
between whom he stood as they marched across
the parade ground. &#8220;If this keeps up much longer
I&#8217;m going to be a wreck!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, some chow will set you up all right,&#8221; commented
Ned.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, say that again!&#8221; sighed the stout lad.
&#8220;Them words fill me with mad desire!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, and you&#8217;ll fill the guardhouse if you don&#8217;t
stop talking so loud in the ranks,&#8221; warned a lad
behind Bob. &#8220;Cut it out. The lieutenant is looking
this way,&#8221; he added, speaking from the corner
of his mouth so the motion of his lips would not be
observed.</p>
<p>Rapidly the young soldiers marched across the
grass-grown parade ground, in orderly array, in
the last of the drills that morning. The company
to which Ned, Bob and Jerry belonged were
drawn up near their barracks, and Captain Theodore
Martin, after a glance over the two trim
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_7' name='page_7'></a>7</span>
lines, turned the dismissing of the group over to
the first lieutenant.</p>
<p>The breechblocks of the guns were opened,
clicked shut again, and then came the welcome
words:</p>
<p>&#8220;Comp <i>sissed</i>!&#8221;</p>
<p>That is what the lieutenant snapped out. But
what he really meant, and what the members of
it understood, was:</p>
<p>&#8220;Company dismissed!&#8221;</p>
<p>Ned, Bob and Jerry, with sighs of relief, which
were echoed by their comrades, turned to stack
their rifles and then prepared for &#8220;chow,&#8221; or, in
this case, the dinner mess.</p>
<p>As the three chums were heading in the direction
of the mess hall where, every day, two hundred
or more hungry lads and men were fed, they
saw some members of their company turn and run
in a different direction.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hello! what&#8217;s up?&#8221; asked Jerry Hopkins, coming
to a halt.</p>
<p>&#8220;Matter where?&#8221; inquired Ned.</p>
<p>&#8220;Over that way,&#8221; and Jerry pointed. &#8220;Either
somebody is hurt, or there&#8217;s a riot.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s go!&#8221; cried Ned.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wait until after grub,&#8221; advised Bob, with an
anxious look toward the mess hall.</p>
<p>&#8220;It won&#8217;t take but a minute,&#8221; suggested Jerry.
&#8220;Look, everybody&#8217;s going. We might as well be
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_8' name='page_8'></a>8</span>
in it. If everybody is late to mess there&#8217;ll be
enough left for us to eat. Come on!&#8221;</p>
<p>Accepting this argument, that such a general
rush toward the scene of excitement would result
in a general postponement of the meal, Bob, after
a moment of hesitation, joined his two chums.
They rushed toward one of the sleeping barracks,
and saw that a large crowd was congregating
around it.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Anybody hurt?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is the place on fire?&#8221;</p>
<p>These were some of the questions that flew
from one to the other.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a spy!&#8221; some one said. &#8220;They&#8217;ve caught
a German spy in camp, and they&#8217;re going to lynch
him!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, boy!&#8221; yelled Ned. &#8220;We must see this!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t believe it!&#8221; announced Jerry.
&#8220;There&#8217;ve been too many German spy scares.
They all turned out to be fakes. And, anyhow,
there won&#8217;t be any lynching.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe not,&#8221; agreed Bob. &#8220;But there sure is
some excitement.&#8221;</p>
<p>And there was. Even Jerry had to admit that.</p>
<p>As the three Motor Boys&mdash;to give them the
name by which they had been known for some
time&mdash;neared the barracks, the rumors and statements
as to the capture of a spy became more
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_9' name='page_9'></a>9</span>
frequent and certain. There was an excited,
seething crowd about the place.</p>
<p>A lieutenant, whom Ned, Bob and Jerry knew
well, as he came from their town of Cresville,
passed just then. The three chums saluted, and,
when this had been returned, Jerry asked:</p>
<p>&#8220;Can you tell us, Sir, what it&#8217;s all about?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Have they really caught a spy?&#8221; added Bob
eagerly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, whether he is a spy or not I can&#8217;t say,&#8221;
was the answer. &#8220;But I have been told that a
man, who was acting in a suspicious manner about
the camp, has been arrested. Some of the officers
are investigating now. I hardly think he will
prove to be a real spy, though.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He won&#8217;t last long, if he is,&#8221; commented Ned.</p>
<p>&#8220;They have him in the barracks there,&#8221; went
on the lieutenant. &#8220;They will bring him out soon,
I suppose, and put him in the guardhouse. Better
go back, boys,&#8221; he added. &#8220;There&#8217;s too much of
a crowd here now. I must help disperse it.&#8221;</p>
<p>He turned away, but the advice he had given
Ned, Bob and Jerry was not very welcome.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is our sleeping barracks, anyhow,&#8221; said
Ned. &#8220;We have a right to stick around, and go
in, too.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If they let us,&#8221; added Bob.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come on, let&#8217;s try,&#8221; suggested Jerry. &#8220;Here&#8217;s
a place,&#8221; and he led the way through a thinning
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_10' name='page_10'></a>10</span>
portion of the crowd toward one of the doors of
the big wooden shack, in which he and his chums
slept while at Camp Dixton.</p>
<p>Suddenly there came a series of excited shouts
from within the building. Then several soldiers
were seen to rush out as though something had
chased them.</p>
<p>&#8220;What in the world is up now?&#8221; asked Jerry of
his chums.</p>
<p>They pressed forward toward the door from
which the excited soldiers had emerged, and one
of them, seeing that the three chums were about
to enter, cried:</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t go in there!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why not?&#8221; asked Bob.</p>
<p>&#8220;Did the spy try to shoot any one?&#8221; Ned
wanted to know.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t go in!&#8221; yelled another lad. &#8220;There&#8217;s
a snake in there as big as a barrel, and he&#8217;s skipping
around as lively as a kitten! Keep out if
you don&#8217;t want to meet sudden death. Oh, boy!
I saw him open his mouth, and one look was
enough. No more for me!&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>
<h3>A MAN AND A SNAKE</h3>
</div>
<p>Ned, Bob and Jerry paused a moment on the
threshold of the barrack building they had been
about to enter. From within came a sound of
commotion, as if several persons were quickly
rushing to and fro, and there were excited shouts.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come off, Jack, what are you doing? Trying
to string us?&#8221; asked Ned of the lad who had
spoken of the snake.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing of the sort!&#8221; protested the other.
&#8220;As true as I&#8217;m telling you, there&#8217;s a snake loose
in there as big as a barrel, and as long as a fence
rail around one of these cotton plantations!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is he joking, Ted?&#8221; asked Jerry of another of
the lads who had rushed out in such haste.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not a bit of it! I saw the snake myself. It
isn&#8217;t quite as big as a barrel, but it certainly is
long.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Come on, fellows!&#8221; called Jerry to his two
chums. &#8220;We&#8217;ve got to see this!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What!&#8221; cried Jack Wade, &#8220;you aren&#8217;t going
in there, are you?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_12' name='page_12'></a>12</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Why not?&#8221; asked Jerry. &#8220;We&#8217;ve had some
experience with snakes. Besides, we want to see
the spy. Is there a spy inside here, too?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There is!&#8221; cried another lad. &#8220;They caught
the spy dead to rights, planting a bomb under the
officers&#8217; mess building. Wanted to blow &#8217;em all
up when they were eating, I guess. Oh, he&#8217;s a
German spy, all right, and they have him tied
up!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But what connection has he with the snakes?&#8221;
Bob questioned.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not any that I know of,&#8221; replied Jack.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, he has, too!&#8221; asserted one of his chums.
&#8220;The spy had the snake. He was going to let him
loose in camp, hoping he&#8217;d bite and poison a lot
of us, I s&#8217;pose, so we can&#8217;t go to France to fight
the Huns.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Big snakes are seldom poisonous,&#8221; cried Jerry.
&#8220;This may be a python or a boa escaped from
some circus, though I haven&#8217;t heard of any animal
shows being around here lately.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Me, either,&#8221; added Bob. &#8220;Say, are you sure
you saw a snake?&#8221; he asked the lads who had
rushed out in such a hurry.</p>
<p>&#8220;As sure as we see you now, and you&#8217;re not
much smaller around the waist than this same
snake,&#8221; added Jack with a laugh.</p>
<p>&#8220;Cut out the comedy stuff!&#8221; murmured Bob.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, if there&#8217;s a real snake in there I want
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_13' name='page_13'></a>13</span>
to see it!&#8221; exclaimed Jerry. &#8220;Come on!&#8221; and he
pushed open the door which had swung shut after
the exit of the excited lads.</p>
<p>Within the barracks the three Motor Boys saw
a scene of excitement. One end of the big building,
which was filled with cots and bunks, was
comparatively empty, but at the other there was
a group of officers and men. Some of them appeared
to surround the captive, though the three
chums could not just then get a glimpse of him.</p>
<p>&#8220;There it is!&#8221; suddenly cried Ned, pointing.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&mdash;the spy?&#8221; asked Bob.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, the snake! See it?&#8221;</p>
<p>He pointed. There was no doubt of it. A
long, glistening, brown body was seen to glide
under a row of cots.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a snake all right,&#8221; assented Jerry, &#8220;but
not half as big as I thought. It&#8217;s just like one I&#8217;ve
seen&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p>He was interrupted by a voice which rang out
above the murmurs from the group at the other
end of the barracks, and the commanding voice of
Colonel Shield demanded:</p>
<p>&#8220;What is going on here? What is all the excitement
about?&#8221;</p>
<p>It appeared that he had just entered at the
doorway around which were grouped the excited
officers and men.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have caught a spy,&#8221; some one said.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_14' name='page_14'></a>14</span></p>
<p>&#8220;He must have let the big snake loose!&#8221; another
added.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, why don&#8217;t some of you shoot the reptile?&#8221;
asked the colonel. &#8220;A fine lot of soldiers
you are, I must say! Afraid of a snake! Where
will you be when you go up against the Germans?
Some one get a rifle and shoot the snake!&#8221;</p>
<p>At this command a protesting cry came from
the midst of a group of soldiers who were guarding
the man arrested as a spy.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t shoot my snake! Don&#8217;t shoot my pet
snake!&#8221; came the entreaty. &#8220;He is worth a fortune!
Don&#8217;t harm him!&#8221;</p>
<p>There was a commotion&mdash;a scramble. Several
men stumbled and fell, and from their midst a
figure dashed&mdash;a figure at the sight of which a
gasp of astonishment came from the three Motor
Boys.</p>
<p>And since Ned, Bob and Jerry have been called
Motor Boys several times I will take just a moment
here to tell who these lads were and something
about them; also why they were at Camp
Dixton. Of course, the readers who already know
this may skip what immediately follows and proceed
with the story.</p>
<p>As related in the initial volume of the first part
of this series, a book which is named &#8220;The Motor
Boys,&#8221; Ned Slade, Bob Baker and Jerry Hopkins
were chums of long standing. They lived in Cresville,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_15' name='page_15'></a>15</span>
not far from Boston, and the three lads were
well-to-do. Jerry&#8217;s mother was a wealthy widow,
while Bob&#8217;s father was a banker, and Ned&#8217;s a department
store owner.</p>
<p>The Motor Boys were so called because they
spent so much time in or about vehicles that depended
on gasoline motors for their activity.
They began with motorcycles and ended with airships&mdash;though
one should not say ended, for their
activities were far from over.</p>
<p>In the books succeeding the initial volume are
related the various adventures of the Motor Boys,
who journeyed to Mexico, across the plains, and
traveled much on the Atlantic and Pacific, both in
craft on the surface and in submarines. Their
trips above the clouds in aeroplanes and airships
were much enjoyed.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Motor Boys on Road and River,&#8221; was
the last volume of the first series, the final volume
to carry that title.</p>
<p>The second series began with &#8220;Ned, Bob and
Jerry at Boxwood Hall,&#8221; and the only change in
the stories was in the title, for the main characters
were still the &#8220;Motor Boys.&#8221;</p>
<p>The parents of the lads felt that they ought to
do some studying, and, accordingly, Ned, Bob and
Jerry were sent to Boxwood Hall. What took
place there formed not only a well-remembered
part in their lives, but furnished some excitement
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_16' name='page_16'></a>16</span>
as well. When vacation came they went to a
Western ranch and had fun, as well as helped in
an important piece of work.</p>
<p>And then came the Great War.</p>
<p>Our heroes could do nothing less than enlist,
and in the volume called &#8220;Ned, Bob and Jerry in
the Army,&#8221; which immediately precedes this one
you are reading, is told something of their life at
Camp Dixton, one of the training camps in the
South.</p>
<p>There the chums had learned to become soldiers,
and, with others of their kind, were eagerly
awaiting a chance to go over seas and fight it out
with the Huns.</p>
<p>And now we meet them again in the midst of excitement
over a spy scare&mdash;not the first of the kind
to happen in the camp, where, as the readers of
the volume before this will doubtless recall, the
activities of &#8220;Pug&#8221; Kennedy and &#8220;Crooked Nose,&#8221;
formed the basis for some real danger.</p>
<p>&#8220;That snake sure is real!&#8221; cried Bob, as he saw
the serpent writhing about. &#8220;And whoever has
him for a pet must be nervy.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Look! Look!&#8221; exclaimed Jerry. &#8220;The spy
is going right for the snake!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And look who the spy is!&#8221; added Ned.</p>
<p>There were shouts from the officers and men.
Several of the latter had gotten their rifles and
were edging about, trying to find an opening
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_17' name='page_17'></a>17</span>
through which they might fire at the serpent.</p>
<p>The man who had broken away from his captors
rushed toward the end of the building where
Ned, Bob and Jerry had last seen the reptile,
which was now out of sight under some bunks.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t shoot him! Don&#8217;t shoot my pet! He
is worth thousands of dollars!&#8221; cried the reputed
spy.</p>
<p>And then, to the surprise and fear of all save
the Motor Boys, who had an insight into the truth,
the man fairly threw himself forward on the serpent,
as a football player falls on the ball.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, I have you! I have you, my beauty!&#8221;
cried the man. &#8220;You shall not get away from me
again, and they sha&#8217;n&#8217;t shoot you, either!&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>
<h3>A PUZZLED PROFESSOR</h3>
</div>
<p>For a moment there was comparative silence
in the big barrack building. It lasted while the
little man was crossing the room and hurrying toward
the big snake where it could be discerned
under a line of bunks. The words uttered by the
owner of the serpent were heard by the three
chums, as well as by every one else in the building.</p>
<p>And then, as the small man continued on his
way, and finally launched himself at the snake with
outstretched hands and arms, some one uttered a
warning yell.</p>
<p>&#8220;Look out!&#8221; came the cry. &#8220;It&#8217;s only his bluff!
He&#8217;s trying to escape. Catch the spy!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right!&#8221; shouted several, who seemed
to agree with what had been said.</p>
<p>But if the little man&mdash;the &#8220;spy&#8221; as he had been
called&mdash;had it in mind to escape, he was taking a
queer way to go about it. For even as a rush toward
him on the part of those from whose midst
he had escaped began, the little man arose and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_19' name='page_19'></a>19</span>
held clasped in his arms the snake&mdash;or as much
of it as he could raise from the ground. On his
face was a look of anxiety relieved, and he fairly
beamed on those who confronted him. His former,
and would-be, captors had again come to a
halt. Almost any ordinary body of men and boys
would have done the same under like circumstances,
for there is an inherent fear of snakes in
almost every one.</p>
<p>&#8220;Get him! Don&#8217;t let the spy escape!&#8221; came
the cry.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes! Let&#8217;s see you get him&mdash;with that snake
for a protector,&#8221; murmured one.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t mind getting shot at by a German,&#8221;
said a voice, &#8220;but I&#8217;ll be jiggered if I want to be
bitten by a snake.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Shoot the snake!&#8221; came the cry.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, please don&#8217;t, I beg of you!&#8221; pleaded the
little man in a mild voice that, somehow, carried
to the far end of the room. &#8220;Please don&#8217;t shoot
the most valuable snake I ever owned. Really
she is quite harmless; aren&#8217;t you, Ticula?&#8221; and he
looked up at the swaying head of the snake that
was weaving above him, as though to ask the serpent
to speak.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ticula!&#8221; burst out Ned. &#8220;Is that her name,
Professor Snodgrass?&#8221;</p>
<p>The little man started, and peered through his
glasses in the direction of the voice.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_20' name='page_20'></a>20</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Ha! It seems there is some one here who
knows me,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I cannot see him, but I
seem to recognize the voice.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I should think you would,&#8221; chuckled Ned.
&#8220;We&#8217;ve traveled with you often enough, Professor.
But this is a new one&mdash;a pet snake as long as
a lasso.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And named Ticula!&#8221; added Jerry, with a
laugh.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, that is only a name I made up for her
out of her own proper, Latin one,&#8221; explained the
professor. &#8220;Her real name is <i>Python Reticulatus</i>;
but I call her Ticula for short. And, unless I am
greatly mistaken, it was Jerry Hopkins who spoke
to me that time. Am I right?&#8221; and he peered
about rather uncertainly, for the corner where the
three chums were standing was in deep shadow.</p>
<p>&#8220;You are right, Professor,&#8221; said Jerry. &#8220;And
we are as much surprised to see you here as to
&#8216;meet up&#8217; with your snake, as the folks in the South
say. What brought you here?&#8221;</p>
<p>Before Professor Snodgrass could answer&mdash;and
it has been, perhaps, guessed before this that
he was the &#8220;spy&#8221; referred to&mdash;a sudden movement
on the part of the snake made it necessary
for him to devote some attention to his &#8220;pet&#8221; as
he called her.</p>
<p>Ticula seemed uneasy at being stared at by so
many eyes, and she began to writhe and twist as
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_21' name='page_21'></a>21</span>
though anxious to escape. There was a sudden
scramble on the part of the soldiers and officers
in the barrack building, but the three chums, having
faith in their old friend, the little scientist, did
not retreat.</p>
<p>&#8220;There now, Ticula,&#8221; murmured Professor
Snodgrass, in what he doubtless meant to be soothing
terms, &#8220;no one shall harm you. You&#8217;re excited
on account of getting out of your box, I
suppose. But I&#8217;ll soon have you back there.&#8221;</p>
<p>He reached up, and began to stroke the snake
back of the weaving head, and gradually the
forked tongue, that had been playing in and out
with the quickness of lightning, was quieted. Ticula
seemed to regain her composure. She settled
down, wrapping a fold or two about the little
man, who did not seem at all alarmed at the movements
of the snake, though one officer murmured:</p>
<p>&#8220;Great Scott! he&#8217;s taking an awful chance.
That&#8217;s a constrictor, and it can crush an ox!&#8221;</p>
<p>But Professor Snodgrass gazed mildly through
his glasses at those surrounding him and inquired:</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you all three there&mdash;Ned, Bob and
Jerry?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All present and accounted for, Professor,&#8221; answered
Jerry, with a laugh. &#8220;And now that Ticula
seems quiet, perhaps you&#8217;ll explain what it all
means.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I think an explanation is very much in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_22' name='page_22'></a>22</span>
order,&#8221; said the colonel, who had urged some of
his men to shoot the snake.</p>
<p>&#8220;First let me get my pet back in her sleeping
box,&#8221; said the little scientist. &#8220;She will be quieter
then. If one of you gentlemen will have the kindness
to bring me the box you took away from me,
I&#8217;ll put Ticula to sleep.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Bring in the box,&#8221; commanded a lieutenant.
&#8220;We caught this man, Sir,&#8221; said the lieutenant, addressing
the colonel, &#8220;hanging around the officers&#8217;
mess hall with a box. We thought it contained an
infernal machine, and that he might be a German
spy. We brought him here to talk to him, and
then we discovered the snake crawling around.
The box is outside.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Have it examined and brought in,&#8221; said the
colonel. &#8220;It is just possible,&#8221; he added with a
smile, &#8220;that the prisoner is what he claims to be&mdash;a
naturalist. Is there any one here who knows
him?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, Sir,&#8221; answered Ned, Bob and Jerry in a
chorus.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come forward and explain,&#8221; ordered the colonel.</p>
<p>The three chums advanced and saluted. Professor
Snodgrass seemed to be having a little
trouble quieting the snake, which had again raised
her head and was hissing at the crowd in front of
her. Some explanations were necessary, it would
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_23' name='page_23'></a>23</span>
seem, and Ned, Bob and Jerry seemed the best
qualified to offer them.</p>
<p>&#8220;We know Professor Snodgrass very well, Sir,&#8221;
said Jerry. &#8220;He has often traveled with us, and
we have helped him in his collection work. He is
connected with some of the largest museums, and
goes about getting rare specimens for them. He
is no more a German spy than we are.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Glad to know it,&#8221; commented the colonel.
&#8220;Do you know anything about this mysterious box
he had?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No; but it is probably what he says it is&mdash;a
cage for this snake, Sir,&#8221; explained Jerry. &#8220;He
has any number of specimen boxes and cages when
he travels.&#8221;</p>
<p>By this time some of the men had brought in
the box in question. It was painted green, and
was about three feet long&mdash;in itself rather a good
load for one man to carry, not so much on account
of its weight as because of its shape, but with the
big snake inside, one man could not have lifted it.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a snake box,&#8221; said Jerry, after he had
examined it, &#8220;but it is a new one&mdash;I never saw it
before.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I had it made especially for Ticula,&#8221; explained
the professor, who had again succeeded in
quieting the serpent. &#8220;Now, my little pet,&#8221; he
went on, &#8220;I&#8217;ll put you to bed.&#8221;</p>
<p>The box was brought forward and set down on
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_24' name='page_24'></a>24</span>
the floor in front of the professor. The man who
brought it dropped it quickly and made a hasty
retreat at the nearer sight of the reptile.</p>
<p>Then the scientist gently lowered the serpent&#8217;s
head toward the box, which was lined with cloth.
The snake seemed to recognize her quarters, for,
without hesitation, she coiled herself down in the
case, the perforated lid of which was then closed.</p>
<p>&#8220;There, now she is all right,&#8221; said the professor.
&#8220;I shall not let her loose again until to-morrow,
and then&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What?&#8221; yelled a lieutenant. &#8220;Are you going
to turn her loose around here <i>again</i>?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why not?&#8221; asked the professor. &#8220;The observations
I hoped to make to-day as to her feeding
habits in the open have been spoiled because
you arrested me as a spy. I could not conclude
my experiments, and I must continue them to-morrow.
But do not be alarmed. Ticula, though
rather large, is perfectly harmless to man. Indeed,
she has not yet gotten her full growth. She
is only fifteen feet long, and her kind often grows
to twenty-six feet and weighs nearly two hundred
pounds. Ticula is a mere baby.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Some baby!&#8221; murmured a voice, and even the
colonel laughed.</p>
<p>&#8220;And now I suppose I am at liberty to go with
my property?&#8221; asked the professor, looking
around inquiringly.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_25' name='page_25'></a>25</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Well, since it seems that you are not a German
spy, I fail to see that we have any reason for holding
you,&#8221; returned the commandant. &#8220;As for the
snake, I think the men&mdash;and I may say myself&mdash;would
feel obliged if you did not turn it loose
again.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I suppose I can select some other place
for my experiments,&#8221; murmured the professor, in
rather disappointed tones. &#8220;But this spot was
ideal. There are so many rats and mice about
a camp of this sort that a snake or two would be
very beneficial.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have no doubt,&#8221; said the colonel dryly.
&#8220;And yet, somehow, I think I prefer the rodents.
But I should be glad to have you explain further
just what your experiments are in reference to
your reptile. I am interested. I shall be pleased
to have you lunch with me,&#8221; he went on, for, now
that he had a chance to observe, he saw that Professor
Snodgrass was a cultured gentleman, as
well as, he presumed, a devoted scientist. The
colonel was something of a student himself.</p>
<p>&#8220;I should like to lunch with you,&#8221; said the professor,
&#8220;but my three friends&mdash;Ned, Bob and
Jerry&mdash;are here and&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll see you later,&#8221; whispered Jerry.
&#8220;We&#8217;re enlisted men and can&#8217;t mess in the officers&#8217;
quarters. You must dine with the colonel
and we&#8217;ll see you later.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_26' name='page_26'></a>26</span></p>
<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; assented the professor, and accepted
the colonel&#8217;s invitation. &#8220;Help me carry
Ticula out to my auto and I&#8217;ll see you after dinner,&#8221;
he went on to the boys.</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you an auto here?&#8221; asked Bob.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. I left it just beyond the confines of the
camp. I have an old friend of yours with me,
too,&#8221; he went on. &#8220;He helped me carry my snake
here.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;An old friend?&#8221; murmured Bob.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, Pete Bumps who used to be your father&#8217;s
hired man. I&#8217;ve engaged him as a helper since
you boys joined the army. He runs my auto for
me and helps me catch specimens. He isn&#8217;t afraid
of snakes.&#8221;</p>
<p>And old Pete Bumps it was who greeted Ned,
Bob and Jerry as they accompanied the professor
to his car.</p>
<p>Pete had left the Baker service some time ago,
and had secured a place as janitor of a college in
which the professor taught, he briefly explained to
the boys. There the professor had engaged him
just prior to starting out on his present expedition.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come on. We&#8217;ve got to hurry back to mess,&#8221;
said Jerry to his chums. &#8220;But we want to have a
talk with you, Professor, after you finish dining
with the colonel. We want to hear what you are
doing here again. I should think once being taken
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_27' name='page_27'></a>27</span>
for a German spy was enough,&#8221; and he laughed at
the recollection of a former occasion, when the
professor, coming to visit his friends at Camp
Dixton, had been halted on his way through the
lines after some insects.</p>
<p>&#8220;I never thought of that,&#8221; admitted the scientist.
&#8220;I certainly remember coming down here in
the spring, but I forgot about the spy business.&#8221;</p>
<p>This was not surprising, since the professor seldom
remembered for very long anything not directly
connected with his favorite study.</p>
<p>And so, with the snake in the box safely confined
to the care of Pete Bumps in the automobile,
Professor Snodgrass went back to dine with the
colonel, while the three chums hastened to their
delayed mess.</p>
<p>&#8220;You never know when he is going to turn up,&#8221;
remarked Ned.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right,&#8221; agreed Jerry. &#8220;I wonder what
he&#8217;s after now?&#8221;</p>
<p>They did not have long to wait before learning.
Soon after mess they saw the professor coming
down their company street and, as they had a brief
respite from drills on account of the strenuous
work of the morning, the boys took him to a quiet
spot and began to ask him questions.</p>
<p>&#8220;But first of all, tell us if there is anything the
matter?&#8221; begged Jerry. &#8220;You look worried. Are
you?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_28' name='page_28'></a>28</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; admitted the little scientist, &#8220;I don&#8217;t
mind admitting that I am worried&mdash;and puzzled,
too.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What about?&#8221; asked Bob. &#8220;Ticula hasn&#8217;t got
loose, has she?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I went over to see, after dining with your
colonel, whom I found to be a most delightful
man, though his ignorance of reptiles and insects
is painful. But, as I say, I assured myself of the
safety of Ticula. Pete has her in the auto.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then what&#8217;s worrying you?&#8221; demanded Ned.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I have a problem to solve and I don&#8217;t
know how to do it,&#8221; was the answer.</p>
<p>&#8220;Has it anything to do with the war?&#8221; Jerry
queried.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, it has,&#8221; was the unexpected answer.
&#8220;And now that you boys are in the army and expect
to go across to France soon, perhaps you can
help me. I&#8217;ll tell you the puzzle I am trying to
solve.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>
<h3>A TWO-GIRL PROBLEM</h3>
</div>
<p>Jerry Hopkins stretched himself lazily and
comfortably out on the grass under the shade tree
where he and Bob and Ned had taken Professor
Snodgrass for a little talk. They were far removed
from the center of the camp, so the noise
of the men drilling or at their various occupations
came but faintly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you mean that your problem has to be
solved on the other side of the water, Professor?&#8221;
asked Jerry.</p>
<p>&#8220;Part of it has. And I am anxious to get
across as soon as possible to begin.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What?&#8221; cried Ned. &#8220;You don&#8217;t mean to say
you, too, are going to France, Professor?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope to,&#8221; was the answer. &#8220;I have arranged
to go, and I have my passport and some
letters of introduction.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But what are you going for?&#8221; asked Bob.
&#8220;Don&#8217;t you know you will be in the midst of terrible
fighting? You can&#8217;t solve any problems
there. It will be a bedlam of noise.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_30' name='page_30'></a>30</span></p>
<p>&#8220;And the noise is just what I want,&#8221; said Mr.
Snodgrass. &#8220;That is one of my problems&mdash;to find
out the effect of noise on the organisms of certain
insects and reptiles. Men suffer from shell shock,
and why should not insects suffer from the terrific
noise of bursting guns? Most insects are noise-producers
themselves,&#8221; he went on, in something
of his class-room manner, which the boys so well
remembered at Boxwood Hall. &#8220;The grasshopper,
the katydid and the cricket, to give them their
common names, each have a song of their own.
These insects are found in France, as well as here,
though in somewhat different form.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now I have a theory that a long-continued
series of terrific noises may produce structural
changes in insects, so as to change the character
of their &#8216;songs&#8217; as I prefer to call their sounds.
This can best be studied on the battlefields of
France, though I suppose I could get the same
effect here, if there was a continuous thunderstorm
with vivid lightning.</p>
<p>&#8220;But, as that condition is impossible to bring
about, I shall best find it in France, and thither I
am going, soon I hope. This snake experiment
is only a brief one, undertaken at the behest of a
friend of mine who is writing a book on the feeding
habits of pythons.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is that what brought you back to our camp?&#8221;
asked Jerry.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_31' name='page_31'></a>31</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. This particular part of the South at this
season of the year has the very climate suited to
pythons and other large snakes of the tropics.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;s hot enough,&#8221; murmured Bob,
mopping his perspiring face. &#8220;I&#8217;m glad we got
out of drill this afternoon. But go on, Professor.
I didn&#8217;t mean to interrupt you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, there isn&#8217;t much to tell about the snake,&#8221;
said the scientist. &#8220;I purchased Ticula, as I call
her, some time ago from a museum. She is a fine
specimen of the regal python. Originally she
came from Borneo, where she was captured when
very young. As I stated, she has not yet attained
her growth, and I have succeeded in making quite
a pet of her.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Deliver me from such pets!&#8221; murmured Ned.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ticula is not a venomous snake,&#8221; went on the
professor. &#8220;None of the constrictor type of serpents
is, though their power to crush their prey
in their folds is enormous. They depend on that
power, while the poisonous snakes kill their prey
by the use of their venom. But Ticula and I are
quite friendly.</p>
<p>&#8220;My friend, who is writing a book on snakes,
asked me to find out something of how pythons
capture their food, and, knowing there would be
plenty of large rats in the vicinity of a camp, on
account of the great food supply there, I came
here with my pet snake.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_32' name='page_32'></a>32</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose I should have secured permission
from some officer to let loose the serpent near one
of the buildings, but I forgot all about it, thinking
of the problem I have to puzzle over. I also
forgot for the time being, that you boys were here
at Camp Dixton, or I should certainly have communicated
with you and got you to help me.</p>
<p>&#8220;But I went at it alone. Pete and I carried the
box, with the snake in it, of course, close to one of
the buildings. I did not know until later that it
was the officers&#8217; mess hall. Then Pete left me
alone.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How did you manage to get through the sentry
lines unchallenged?&#8221; asked Jerry.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; frankly answered the professor.
&#8220;I suppose it was because no one saw us; or
they may have supposed we were bringing some
supplies to one of the officers. Then, there was
a sham battle going on not far away at the time,
and that may have taken the attention of the sentries.
Anyhow, I got through the lines, and,
opening the box, let Ticula out to roam about and
catch a rat if she could.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was crawling around after her, watching her
as she went under the building when suddenly a
soldier pounced on me and yelled that I was a
German spy. I was never more surprised in all
my life.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jerry and Bob chuckled.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_33' name='page_33'></a>33</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I should think you might be!&#8221; laughed Ned.
&#8220;Then what happened?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, they handled me rather roughly, and
took me into custody, as I suppose it is called.
They seemed to think Ticula&#8217;s box was an infernal
machine. They were very much excited, and I
was trying to explain to them who I was, when
Ticula suddenly crawled up through a hole in the
floor in the building where I was being questioned.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And then there was more excitement, I suppose,&#8221;
said Jerry.</p>
<p>&#8220;There was&mdash;considerable,&#8221; admitted the professor.
&#8220;Then you boys came in, and&mdash;well, it&#8217;s
all over now. But I surely feared for a moment
they might shoot my snake.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, it was rather a close call,&#8221; observed Bob.
&#8220;But did you have a good dinner with the colonel?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Listen to him, would you!&#8221; protested Ned.
&#8220;All he can think of is eating!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Cut it out!&#8221; growled Bob, as Ned poked him
in the ribs. &#8220;I just wanted to know what sort of
feed they give the officers.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; said Jerry significantly. &#8220;Merely an
academic interest, I suppose.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure!&#8221; assented Bob. &#8220;That&#8217;s all.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, the dinner was very good, though I cannot
say that I remember what I ate,&#8221; confessed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_34' name='page_34'></a>34</span>
the professor. &#8220;I was thinking too much of something
else.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you mean you were puzzled as to how to
study the effect of the noises of the French battlefields
on grasshoppers and crickets?&#8221; asked Jerry.</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; and the professor shook his head.
&#8220;This is an altogether different problem. It is, as
I might call it, the problem of two girls.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Two girls!&#8221; cried the three Motor Boys in a
chorus. &#8220;Two girls?&#8221;</p>
<p>They looked at the little professor, whose eyes,
mildly blinking behind his strong glasses, regarded
the lads curiously.</p>
<p>&#8220;Two girls,&#8221; repeated the little scientist. &#8220;The
problem I have to solve concerns two girls.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>
<h3>MORE GIRLS</h3>
</div>
<p>Ned, Bob and Jerry looked at one another.
Then they turned their glances on the professor.</p>
<p>&#8220;Whew!&#8221; softly whistled Jerry. &#8220;Can it be
possible that our dear friend is in love&mdash;and with
two girls at once? This is getting serious!&#8221;</p>
<p>It would have been had Jerry&#8217;s diagnosis been
correct. But it was wrong, as was proved a moment
later, when the professor, with a sigh, resumed
his narrative.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I am much concerned over two
girls&mdash;young ladies I suppose would be the more
proper designation. I have never seen either of
them.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jerry breathed more freely, and so did his
chums. Clearly if the professor had not seen the
two girls he could not be in love with them. And
the professor in love was something unthinkable.
He never would have remembered, from one day
to the next, the name of the favored lady.</p>
<p>&#8220;And, boys,&#8221; went on Professor Snodgrass, &#8220;I
think you will agree with me that it is quite a problem
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_36' name='page_36'></a>36</span>
to try to find in Europe, at this particular
time, two girls I have never seen, that I may deliver
to them a small fortune, and claim one myself.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, this is getting worse and more of it!&#8221;
cried Ned. &#8220;What does it all mean, Professor?
Are you in earnest about these girls and the effect
of war noises on insects?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am in earnest about both problems&mdash;never
more so,&#8221; was the answer, and it needed but a
glance at the face of the scientist to disclose this
fact. &#8220;But perhaps I had better explain.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps you had,&#8221; said Jerry with a smile.</p>
<p>&#8220;And never mind about the insects&mdash;tell us
about the girls,&#8221; urged Bob.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, relieve his mind,&#8221; agreed Ned. &#8220;He
hasn&#8217;t heard from his dear Helena in some hours,
I guess.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, cut it out!&#8221; protested the stout lad.</p>
<p>&#8220;The two girls to whom I refer,&#8221; went on Professor
Snodgrass, &#8220;are the nieces of my late
friend, Professor Emil Petersen.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The man who wrote the book on trigonometry
that we used to study at Boxwood Hall?&#8221;
asked Ned.</p>
<p>&#8220;The same,&#8221; murmured Professor Snodgrass.
&#8220;Professor Petersen was an eminent mathematician,
and the world did not fully estimate his
worth. His mathematical work was only a branch
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_37' name='page_37'></a>37</span>
of his many-sided activities. Professor Petersen
died about three months ago, and he left me a
most peculiar legacy.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Peculiar in what way?&#8221; asked Ned.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is like this,&#8221; said the little scientist, as he
pulled up a blade of grass, and examined it under
a powerful hand glass to see if any strange insects
might be crawling on it. &#8220;Professor Petersen,
unlike most of us professional men, was very
wealthy. He was a Swede, and his wealth came to
him from his father. He never used much of it,
and the money accumulated.</p>
<p>&#8220;After his death I was surprised to learn that
he had made me one of his heirs, but under certain
conditions. It appears that in his younger
days Professor Petersen was estranged from his
brother and sister, on account of some family matters.
They received an equal share with him from
their father&#8217;s estate, but they made unwise investments,
and soon lost the major portion of their
inheritances. The professor kept his. Perhaps
that was one reason for the estrangement.</p>
<p>&#8220;At any rate, some coldness existed, and it was
not until just before his death that the professor
wished to be reconciled. Then it was too late, as
his brother and sister were both dead. But each
had left a daughter, and the young ladies were
studying abroad&mdash;somewhere in France or Germany,
I believe, when the war broke out.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_38' name='page_38'></a>38</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I was greatly surprised, when the will was
made public, to learn that I was to have half the
professor&#8217;s not inconsiderable wealth, on a certain
condition.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And what condition?&#8221; remarked Jerry, as the
professor hesitated.</p>
<p>&#8220;That condition is as follows. I am to seek out
these two nieces of my dead friend and give them
each a fourth of his estate. The other half I am
to have for myself if I fulfill the trust. That is, I
get it if I can succeed in finding the two girls, and
I need not tell you that I shall be very glad of the
large sum of money&mdash;not for myself, oh, no!&#8221;
said Professor Snodgrass quickly, &#8220;but that I may
devote it to the furtherance of the interests of
science. If I can solve the problem, and find the
two girls, I shall have a large sum at my disposal,
and I can then fulfill a life-long desire to undertake
the study of the insects of the Amazon River.
That is what I have always desired to do since I
took up my studies, but I always lacked the means.
Now, if I succeed in finding these two girls, I shall
have wealth enough to travel in South America.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And where are the girls?&#8221; asked Jerry.</p>
<p>&#8220;Somewhere in Germany or France,&#8221; was the
answer. &#8220;The latter country, I think. I have,
among my papers, their last address. But since
the war there is no telling where I may find them.
I have written a number of letters, but have had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_39' name='page_39'></a>39</span>
no answers. Now I must go to seek them, and,
at the same time, make a study of the effect of battle
noises on crickets and grasshoppers. Is it any
wonder that I seem puzzled? Was there ever
such a hard problem for a peace-loving scientist
to solve?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It isn&#8217;t going to be easy,&#8221; admitted Ned.
&#8220;Then you really expect to go across?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. And since I understand you are going,
we may go together; or at least meet there, for I
suppose I shall not be allowed on a transport, being
a civilian.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hardly,&#8221; assented Jerry. &#8220;But if, as you
say, you have passports and credentials and letters
of introduction, it may be arranged. You had
better see our colonel. He seems to have taken
quite a notion to you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you; I will,&#8221; promised the scientist.
&#8220;And now I think I had better go back and see
about Ticula and Pete Bumps. Pete may be worried
about me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Just a moment,&#8221; suggested Ned. &#8220;If we are
to help you in the search for these two girls, we
ought to know something more about them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That is right,&#8221; assented the professor; &#8220;and
I hope you will help me. The problem of finding
the two young ladies would be easy were it not
for the war. But they have been missing since
the conflict started, and I can get no trace of them.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_40' name='page_40'></a>40</span>
I hope they are still living, for, if they are
dead, all the wealth Professor Petersen left goes
to a humane society for the care of distressed cats
and dogs and to provide a shelter for them. Not
that I object to cats and dogs,&#8221; he hastily added,
&#8220;but I think some other form of scientific activity
might be chosen. However, Professor Petersen
was very peculiar, and, after all, it was his money.
Will you boys help me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Indeed we will!&#8221; cried Jerry. &#8220;But how are
we to go about it? What part of France were
the girls last in?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And what are their names?&#8221; Bob demanded.</p>
<p>&#8220;And what do they look like?&#8221; asked Ned.</p>
<p>&#8220;That last question I can answer first,&#8221; said
the professor. &#8220;I happen to have recent pictures
of them. They sent them to their uncle following
the deaths of their parents, and after the reconciliation,
and Professor Petersen left them to me,
with certain other material, documents and such,
to aid me in the search. Here are the girls&mdash;their
names are Gladys Petersen and Dorothy
Gibbs.&#8221;</p>
<p>He reached in his pocket and took out a folded
paper. As he opened it he gave a start and hastily
closed it again.</p>
<p>&#8220;That isn&#8217;t it,&#8221; he murmured. &#8220;Those are
some dried specimens of <i>ameba</i> that I wish to
study under a microscope.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_41' name='page_41'></a>41</span></p>
<p>&#8220;What are <i>ameba</i>?&#8221; asked Jerry. &#8220;Fish?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not exactly,&#8221; answered the professor with a
smile, &#8220;though I secured these from a little pond
on the other side of the camp. <i>Ameba</i> are microorganisms
of the simplest structure&mdash;a protoplasm
which is constantly changing in shape. Very interesting&mdash;very
interesting indeed, but not the pictures
of the girls. Ah, here they are,&#8221; he added,
as he replaced the first paper and took out a second.
From the folds of that he produced two
unmounted photographs at which the boys gazed
with interest.</p>
<p>They saw the likenesses of two pretty girls in
traveling costume, and the pictures had, obviously,
been snapped by an amateur at some country
place, for there was a barn and fields in the background.</p>
<p>&#8220;The girls took these pictures themselves, I
understand,&#8221; explained the professor. &#8220;They
sent them to their uncle.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Which is which?&#8221; asked Jerry. &#8220;I mean
which is Gladys and which is Dorothy?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The names are on the reverse side of the
photographs, I believe,&#8221; said the professor, and
so it proved.</p>
<p>&#8220;They are both pretty,&#8221; observed Jerry.</p>
<p>&#8220;I rather fancy Gladys,&#8221; murmured Ned.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dorothy seems real jolly,&#8221; stated Bob.</p>
<p>&#8220;Here! None of that, young man, or I&#8217;ll write
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_42' name='page_42'></a>42</span>
to Helena Schaeffer, and tell her how you&#8217;re carrying
on!&#8221; warned Jerry, shaking a finger at his
stout chum.</p>
<p>&#8220;Aw, you&#8211;&#8211;&#8221; began Bob.</p>
<p>But at that moment there came an interruption.
A small, very much excited lad came fairly bounding
over the grass toward the figures of the three
chums and Professor Snodgrass.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, here you are!&#8221; cried the newcomer.
&#8220;Found you at last&mdash;thought I never would&mdash;asked
everybody&mdash;nearly got stabbed by a sentry&mdash;had
to jump out of the way of a bullet&mdash;whoop&mdash;but
here I am&mdash;Gosh! Say, it&#8217;s good to see
you again&mdash;I told &#8217;em I could find you&mdash;awful
hot, ain&#8217;t it? Lots of things going on&mdash;never
saw so many soldiers in all my life&mdash;here they are,
girls! I found &#8217;em!&#8221;</p>
<p>Ned, Bob and Jerry gazed in amazement at
the small lad. Ned murmured his name&mdash;Andy
Rush&mdash;and then Jerry, looking over the head of
the excited little chap, descried three girls approaching.</p>
<p>&#8220;Girls! Girls!&#8221; murmured the tall lad.
&#8220;More girls! What does it mean?&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>
<h3>NODDY NIXON</h3>
</div>
<p>Events were transpiring so rapidly for Ned,
Bob and Jerry in the last few hours, that it was
no wonder they were somewhat startled. Coming
from strenuous bayonet practice to hear of a spy
alarm, to have that augmented by excitement over
the big snake, to learn that the &#8220;spy&#8221; was none
other than Professor Snodgrass, and then to hear
of his strange mission, would have been almost
too much for any group of lads less sophisticated
than this trio.</p>
<p>And hardly had they digested the news about
the two missing girls, in a search for whom they
mentally agreed they would join, than along came
excitable Andy Rush and&mdash;more girls.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s Mollie Horton!&#8221; cried Ned, recognizing
a girl who lived near him in Cresville, and
with whom he was very friendly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, and I see Alice Vines,&#8221; added Jerry.</p>
<p>&#8220;And Helen Gale is with her,&#8221; commented Bob.
&#8220;I&#8217;m glad she came! Helen&#8217;s a great girl for
sport and&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;d better be careful how you talk,&#8221; warned
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_44' name='page_44'></a>44</span>
Jerry, as the girls continued to approach. &#8220;Helen
and Helena are names very much alike, but if you
get them mixed up&mdash;well, Helen isn&#8217;t one to stand
any nonsense.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Aw, say&#8211;&#8211;&#8221; began Bob, and then the nearer
approach of the three girls, to whom Andy Rush
was beckoning, put a stop to any further talk concerning
them.</p>
<p>It might be added, to explain Jerry&#8217;s reference,
that Helena Schaeffer was a girl in whom Bob
Baker felt more than ordinary interest. At first,
because of the pro-German leanings of her father,
she had been a bit cold toward Bob when he joined
the army with his chums, to fight the Kaiser.
But, as readers of the volume preceding this know,
Helena changed her attitude, much to Bob&#8217;s relief.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, of all the sights that are good for sore
eyes!&#8221; cried Ned, as he hurried forward to greet
the girls, an example followed by his chums.
&#8220;What fine wind blew you here?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We didn&#8217;t come in an airship!&#8221; burst out
Andy Rush. &#8220;I wanted to, but they wouldn&#8217;t&mdash;&#8217;fraid
they&#8217;d fall&mdash;swoop up&mdash;swoop down&mdash;get
here quicker&mdash;fall maybe&mdash;maybe not&mdash;lots of
fun, anyhow. Gosh, it&#8217;s great&mdash;I say, fellows,
are you going&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p>Jerry gently but firmly took hold of Andy by
the ear, and, pointing to Professor Snodgrass,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_45' name='page_45'></a>45</span>
who was wandering about a distant field in search
of possible insects, said:</p>
<p>&#8220;Andy, you go and aid in the interests of
science, and, incidentally, cool off. We&#8217;ll see you
later.&#8221;</p>
<p>And Andy, whose rapid flow of words had been
suddenly stopped, looked once at the tall, bronzed
lad, and then followed the instructions to the letter.
So, whether he wanted it or not, Professor
Snodgrass had the assistance of the small youth.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well! Well!&#8221; exclaimed Jerry, as he shook
hands lingeringly with Alice. &#8220;How did you get
here?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Going to enlist?&#8221; asked Ned.</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe they&#8217;re going to join the girls&#8217; motor
corps,&#8221; suggested Bob, who had attached himself
to Helen.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, we just came on a visit,&#8221; explained Mollie.</p>
<p>&#8220;To see us?&#8221; asked Ned.</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course!&#8221; was the mischievous answer.
&#8220;We got lonesome back in Cresville, with all the
nice boys gone, and so we got Andy to bring us
down here.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And if we believe that, I suppose you&#8217;ll tell
us another,&#8221; laughed Jerry. &#8220;Seriously now, how
did you happen to come, and how long are you
going to stay? Fellows, we&#8217;ll have to get furloughs
and take the girls around. Not that there&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_46' name='page_46'></a>46</span>
much to see down here, but we&#8217;ll do our best,&#8221;
he added.</p>
<p>&#8220;Cease! Cease!&#8221; commanded Ned, holding
up his hand like a traffic officer in front of Jerry.
&#8220;Let&#8217;s hear how they happened to come.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, that is soon told,&#8221; remarked Alice.
&#8220;Mollie&#8217;s aunt lives not far from here.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And she invited Mollie down on a visit,&#8221;
added Helen. &#8220;And Mollie was good enough to
ask us, so we all came together. We reached
there yesterday, and, knowing you boys were at
camp here, we decided to come out to see you,
which we have done.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And for which we are duly grateful,&#8221; added
Jerry. &#8220;But what about Andy Rush? I never
was more surprised in my life when I heard his
usual flow of language. How did he happen to
be with you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That was just an accident, a coincidence, or
whatever you want to call it,&#8221; said Mollie, with a
laugh. &#8220;When Andy heard we were coming down
this way he asked if he couldn&#8217;t come with us.
He says he is going to enlist. He isn&#8217;t going to
wait to be drafted. He said he&#8217;d sort of look
after us on our way down.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But it&#8217;s been the other way about!&#8221; laughed
Alice. &#8220;We&#8217;ve had to watch him all the while.
He was always hopping about, talking to strangers,
and every time the train stopped at a station
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_47' name='page_47'></a>47</span>
longer than a minute he&#8217;d get off, and we&#8217;d be in
a fix for fear he&#8217;d be left. But he&#8217;s here, thank
goodness!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Going to enlist!&#8221; cried Ned. &#8220;Why, he&#8217;s too
<i>small</i>.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what they told him back in Cresville
when he tried it,&#8221; remarked Alice. &#8220;But we must
give Andy credit for being a determined little
chap. He&#8217;s sixteen, and he says lots of boys of
sixteen have gone in, and he&#8217;s going. He said if
the recruiting officer at home wouldn&#8217;t take him
one here at camp might. So he came with us, and
I believe he&#8217;s going to ask you boys to use your
influence to get him into the army.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A heap of influence we have!&#8221; laughed Ned.
&#8220;Privates&mdash;with Jerry just made corporal.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, Andy was very nice to us on the way
down,&#8221; said Helen, &#8220;so please do all you can for
him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We will!&#8221; promised Jerry. &#8220;And now tell us
about yourselves, and how all the folks are at
home. Oh, but it&#8217;s great to see you again!&#8221;</p>
<p>Then followed a talk until it was time for the
three chums to report for drill duty.</p>
<p>&#8220;What are you girls going to do this evening?&#8221;
asked Bob.</p>
<p>The girls looked at one another.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, just sit around, I suppose,&#8221; remarked
Mollie.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_48' name='page_48'></a>48</span></p>
<p>&#8220;No, you&#8217;re not!&#8221; cried Jerry. &#8220;There&#8217;s a
dance in town&mdash;a really nice place&mdash;and we&#8217;ve
been wishing for some girls to come along to help
us out. It&#8217;s under the auspices of the local Y. W.
C. A. And if we can get off&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, we&#8217;ll get off all right!&#8221; broke in Ned
eagerly.</p>
<p>&#8220;If worst comes to worst, we&#8217;ll have the professor
ask the colonel on our behalf. The prof
seems to pull a pretty good stroke with the C. O.
So a dance it is to be!&#8221; declared Bob.</p>
<p>And a dance it was. The boys received permission
to remain away from camp until midnight,
passes being issued to them, and they at once proceeded
to &#8220;doll up,&#8221; as Bob expressed it.</p>
<p>A joyous week followed, for the girls were to
remain in the vicinity of Camp Dixton, at Mollie&#8217;s
aunt&#8217;s house for some time, and they asked nothing
better than to have the company of the three
chums as often as it might be possible.</p>
<p>Of course, Ned, Bob and Jerry did not have
very much time to themselves during the day, and
some of their nights were occupied. But fate
was kind to them, and they had several dances
with the girls, and also went to &#8220;shows&#8221; at the
local Y. M. C. A., as well as entertaining the girls
by escorting them about the cantonment.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Professor Snodgrass received permission
to loose his pet snake, Ticula, in certain
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_49' name='page_49'></a>49</span>
restricted areas, so that he might observe her feeding
habits in the open.</p>
<p>&#8220;But I cannot stay here very long,&#8221; he told the
boys. &#8220;I must soon begin to prepare for my trip
to Europe. I simply must make an attempt to
find those two girls.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And we&#8217;ll help you!&#8221; declared Jerry. &#8220;Just
wait a few days more. I think our orders to go
across are coming.&#8221;</p>
<p>And come the orders did. The day before the
three home-town girls were to return to Cresville
orders came for the larger part of the soldiers at
Camp Dixton to leave for France.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hurray!&#8221; cried Ned, Bob and Jerry, as they
saw the orders posted. &#8220;Now we&#8217;ll get a whack
at the Germans!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And I&#8217;m going, too!&#8221; declared Andy Rush.
&#8220;I&#8217;ll go if I have to leave as a stowaway! I&#8217;ve
simply got to fight&mdash;get me a gun&mdash;let me go in
an aeroplane&mdash;I want action&mdash;got to do something&mdash;can&#8217;t
keep still&mdash;Hurray for Uncle Sam!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, you&#8217;ll burst a blood vessel if you aren&#8217;t
careful!&#8221; cautioned Ned. &#8220;Better go slow,
Andy.&#8221;</p>
<p>But Andy Rush was not the lad for that, and
he hurried about the camp, more excited than
ever, seeking for a chance to go abroad.</p>
<p>Ned, Bob and Jerry, with thousands of their
chums, were to go to Hoboken, New Jersey, there
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_50' name='page_50'></a>50</span>
to go aboard a transport and be escorted to
France. By a stroke of good luck, and by pulling
some official, or scientific wires, Professor Snodgrass
received permission to go on the same vessel.
He hurriedly sent his pet snake to a museum
to be cared for until his return, mailed his specimens
of <i>ameba</i> to a scientific friend to be made
into microscopical slides, and then, having fitted
himself out with as many specimen boxes and
other paraphernalia as he was permitted to take,
announced that he was ready for his dual mission&mdash;the
seeking out of the two girls that he might
apprise them of their good fortune and to undertake
the study of the effect of war noises on crickets
and katydids.</p>
<p>The final drills, bayonet practices, hikes and
other camp activities were held, and then the order
came to break camp. Professor Snodgrass
went on ahead, promising to meet the three chums
in Hoboken, and Mollie, Alice and Helen departed
for Cresville, their good-byes to the boys
being rather tearful, it must be admitted.</p>
<p>As for Andy Rush, he disappeared on the day
when the young soldiers were to take the train for
the North, and no one seemed to know what had
become of him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Guess he found he couldn&#8217;t get in the army,
and he went back home,&#8221; remarked Ned.</p>
<p>Finally the three chums were on their way for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_51' name='page_51'></a>51</span>
the fighting front with thousands of fellow soldiers,
some being volunteers and others of the
selective service.</p>
<p>Many and varied were the thoughts of our
heroes as the train bore them northward. What
would be their fate in France? Would they ever
see home again, or would they be left across the
water with the others who died that civilization
might live? And mingled with these thoughts
were others as to the mission of Professor Snodgrass.</p>
<p>&#8220;It surely is some commission&mdash;trying to find
two girls with just their photographs and nothing
much else to go by,&#8221; commented Ned.</p>
<p>&#8220;But we have done harder things,&#8221; added
Jerry.</p>
<p>The journey North was rather tiresome, but
the boys and their companions enlivened it as
much as possible by singing, telling stories, and
general activities.</p>
<p>Once, when the train was delayed at a junction
the three Cresville friends got out, as did hundreds
of others, to &#8220;stretch their legs.&#8221; There
was another train-load of young soldiers on a siding,
having come from another camp, and lads
from this were also walking up and down.</p>
<p>As Ned, Bob and Jerry stood together, looking
at a group of recruits who had been trained in
Texas, they heard a voice saying:
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_52' name='page_52'></a>52</span></p>
<p>&#8220;This drafting business makes me sick! I don&#8217;t
like it at all!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe you&#8217;d rather have been passed over,&#8221;
suggested some one.</p>
<p>&#8220;Naw, you get me wrong!&#8221; was the answer. &#8220;I
want to fight all right, but I want to do it my own
way. I&#8217;d have enlisted in the air service if they&#8217;d
given me time enough. I was thinking of it when
the draft law went into effect, and then I couldn&#8217;t.
I know a lot about airships. I used to run one,
and I invented one, too.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Did it fly?&#8221; some one wanted to know.</p>
<p>&#8220;It would have if it hadn&#8217;t been for some mean
fellows in my town who didn&#8217;t want me to beat
them,&#8221; was the announcement. &#8220;You wait until
I get on the other side! I&#8217;ll show &#8217;em what flying
is, if they give me the chance, and Jerry Hopkins
and his pals sha&#8217;n&#8217;t stop me, either!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you hear that?&#8221; asked Ned in a low
voice.</p>
<p>&#8220;I should say so!&#8221; exclaimed Bob. &#8220;We ought
to know who that is.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Noddy Nixon, without a doubt!&#8221; remarked
Jerry. &#8220;And up to his old tricks! I hope he
isn&#8217;t going on the same transport with us!&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>
<h3>OFF FOR FRANCE</h3>
</div>
<p>Noddy Nixon needs no introduction to my old
readers. This rich and impudent lad had, more
than once, done his best to injure the Motor Boys,
and, with the plotting of Jack Pender and Bill
Berry, a Cresville n&#8217;er-do-well, had too often succeeded.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I don&#8217;t see anything of Bill or Jack,&#8221;
observed Jerry, as he looked toward Noddy
Nixon, and noted, that the bully was surrounded
by a group of strange recruits.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, if he&#8217;s by himself he won&#8217;t be so hard to
handle,&#8221; agreed Ned. &#8220;But I wonder where he
came from? He ought to be in jail!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose he came from some training camp&mdash;same
as we did,&#8221; observed Bob. &#8220;And he
looks as though he had been well fed, too. He&#8217;s
as fat as butter.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s Chunky all over&mdash;thinking of the eating
end,&#8221; laughed Ned.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, Noddy is fat all right&mdash;too fat!&#8221; declared
Jerry. &#8220;He hasn&#8217;t been drilled as hard as we
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_54' name='page_54'></a>54</span>
have, or else he got a desk position somewhere
and held on to it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you hear the bluff he was throwing about
trying to enlist in the air service?&#8221; asked Ned.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; agreed his tall chum. &#8220;Talk about his
being an expert flier! Say, do you remember his
<i>Tin Fly</i>?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I should say so!&#8221; laughed Bob. &#8220;The flying
machine that wouldn&#8217;t go up. That was a hot
one! But keep quiet&mdash;he&#8217;s looking over this
way.&#8221;</p>
<p>Noddy, indeed, seemed to have his attention
attracted to the three friends. At first he looked
uncomprehendingly, and then, as the features of
the lads toward whom he had acted so meanly
became plainer, he stared and finally exclaimed:</p>
<p>&#8220;What are you fellows doing here?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The same as you, I imagine,&#8221; was Jerry&#8217;s cool
answer. &#8220;We are going to fight in France.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jerry said afterward he wanted to add that he
and his chums had &#8220;volunteered&#8221; to do this fighting,
but he did not think it would be quite fair to
the drafted men with Noddy who, to do them justice,
were in the same class as the best of patriots.
The selective service law solved many problems,
but Noddy&#8217;s was not among them. As the boys
learned later, the town bully had done his best to
evade the draft, and had only registered when
threatened with military action.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_55' name='page_55'></a>55</span></p>
<p>Then he made a virtue of necessity and talked
big about having tried to volunteer in the air service,
only to be refused. But most of those who
heard Noddy Nixon talk understood him, and
were not at all taken in.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;d you fellows train?&#8221; asked Noddy,
moving over toward his Cresville acquaintances.</p>
<p>&#8220;Camp Dixton,&#8221; answered Ned. Then he
added to Bob and Jerry: &#8220;Come on, fellows, I
think our train&#8217;s about to pull out.&#8221;</p>
<p>None of the Motor Boys had any relish for
talk with their former enemy. As for Noddy, he
seemed to think he was doing them a favor by
noticing them, and as they turned away he said:</p>
<p>&#8220;Camp Dixton isn&#8217;t in it with Upyank, where
our bunch was trained! We&#8217;ll show you when we
get to France!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope we don&#8217;t run across him,&#8221; murmured
Jerry, as they got back to their seats, for Ned&#8217;s
alarm had proved true, and their train soon did
pull out. Noddy and his crowd were a little later
in starting from the junction, and then, as the
Motor Boys were hauled on to their destination to
embark for France, they discussed the past doings
of the bully, and wondered how he would
conduct himself in war.</p>
<p>From that they switched to the more pleasant
topic of the recent visit of the girls, and speculated
on what had become of Andy Rush.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_56' name='page_56'></a>56</span></p>
<p>&#8220;They might enlist him and let him talk some
of the Huns to death,&#8221; suggested Ned. &#8220;He
could do that to perfection. But I&#8217;m afraid he&#8217;s
too small to get in the army.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I wonder if we&#8217;ll ever find the professor&#8217;s two
girls?&#8221; ventured Bob, meaning thereby Gladys
Petersen and Dorothy Gibbs.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t believe we&#8217;ll have much time to look
for them, if the fighting keeps up as fiercely as it
has,&#8221; and Jerry handed his chums a paper he had
purchased, which gave a detailed account of some
of the first fighting of the American Expeditionary
Force, in the Toul sector, at Seicheprey. This
fighting had taken place in April, and it was late
in June when Ned, Bob and Jerry, with others
from their camp, were on their way to France in
that great movement of troops which was to
prove the turning, and winning, point of the war.
The account in the paper of the fighting at Seicheprey
was a delayed one sent through the mail by
a correspondent.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, it is getting hot,&#8221; observed Ned. &#8220;But
still we promised the professor we&#8217;d help him look
for the girls.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And so we shall, if we get the chance,&#8221; declared
Jerry. &#8220;I know what it would mean to the
professor if he lost his half of the fortune and
had to give up his work on the insects of the
Amazon. Oh, we&#8217;ll help him all right!&#8221;</p>

<p>The journey of the boys to the &#8220;Atlantic Seaport,&#8221;
as Hoboken and New York, as well as
other well-known cities, were called in the newspapers
during the war, was not eventful. Their
train was one of many hundreds rushing troops
to the transports, and in due time Ned, Bob and
Jerry found themselves getting off at a big dock
in Hoboken and going aboard a transport&mdash;a former
German liner, her machinery rebuilt after the
ship&#8217;s German crew had done their best to disable
it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, we&#8217;re here!&#8221; announced Jerry, as he
eased his pack from his shoulders to the deck, an
example followed by Ned and Bob.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, we&#8217;re here, and we&#8217;ll soon be&mdash;there!&#8221;
and Ned nodded in the direction of France&mdash;or
where he thought it was.</p>
<p>Somewhere a band was playing. Thousands of
soldiers were crowding on board, and there would
be more thousands after them&mdash;a stream that
would not end until Prussianism had been dealt its
death-blow.</p>
<p>There was a period of seeming chaos while the
troops were getting settled and disposing of their
baggage. Then the three chums had a chance to
look about them, and proceeding to the stern of
the vessel they glanced across the Hudson to New
York, where the towering buildings showed dimly
through a harbor haze.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_58' name='page_58'></a>58</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Wonder when we&#8217;ll see them again,&#8221; remarked
Jerry, in a low voice.</p>
<p>Neither of his chums answered. They were
thinking, though.</p>
<p>Late that afternoon the preparation and bustle
seemed redoubled. More soldiers and a number
of officers came aboard, and then, suddenly, after
bugles had blared and bells had clanged, there
was a tremor through the big transport.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re off!&#8221; cried Bob.</p>
<p>&#8220;For France!&#8221; added Ned.</p>
<p>&#8220;And I&#8217;m glad to be with you!&#8221; said a voice
behind Jerry, who, turning, beheld Professor
Snodgrass.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>
<h3>THE TRAINING CAMP</h3>
</div>
<p>My readers may well guess that Ned, Bob and
Jerry were glad to see the scientist. He was
like part of their &#8220;own folks,&#8221; and though they
had many friends among their army chums, and
though they liked, and were liked, by their officers,
our three heroes felt that with Professor Snodgrass
along it was like taking part of Cresville
aboard with them.</p>
<p>&#8220;So you got here all right, did you?&#8221; asked
Ned with a smile, as he and the others shook
hands with the scientist.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I&#8217;m here; and I wish we were across. I
dread the voyage.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Submarines?&#8221; asked Jerry.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, no, I wasn&#8217;t thinking of them,&#8221; answered
the professor. &#8220;But I am anxious to get across,
not only to begin my study of the effect of war
noises on European insects, but to search for those
two young ladies. I have been reading considerable
about war conditions in France and Germany
since Professor Petersen made me his part heir,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_60' name='page_60'></a>60</span>
and I fear the young ladies may have a hard
time.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, they are very likely to,&#8221; assented Ned.
&#8220;But until we get there we can&#8217;t do anything to
help them. However, we&#8217;ll do our best for you
and them when we do get there&mdash;if we have a
chance&mdash;after getting a Hun or two,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right,&#8221; said Mr. Snodgrass. &#8220;The winning
of the war is the first consideration. I wish
I were young enough to fight. But I have contributed
to the Red Cross, to the Salvation Army,
the Knights of Columbus and the Y. M. C. A.
and the Y. W. C. A.; and I&#8217;ve mailed every magazine
I finished reading and sent over all the books
I could spare.&#8221;</p>
<p>The boys winked at one another. They gave
full credit to Professor Snodgrass for his contributions
to the five organizations, which, with the
Jewish Welfare League, did so much to help win
the war.</p>
<p>&#8220;But if the boys in camp over there had to depend
for reading on the dry, scientific magazines
and books the professor sent them they&#8217;d be hard
put,&#8221; commented Jerry to his chums, afterward.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, we&#8217;re moving, anyhow,&#8221; observed Bob,
as he and the others noticed that tugs were backing
the transport out into the river. &#8220;Now that
we&#8217;re under way, don&#8217;t you think we&#8217;d better go
and see about&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_61' name='page_61'></a>61</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Grub!&#8221; finished Jerry, fairly taking the word
out of Chunky&#8217;s mouth.</p>
<p>The stout lad glared a moment, and then said:</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, yes, grub! Why not? We have to
eat, don&#8217;t we?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You said it, Bob!&#8221; exclaimed Ned. &#8220;Go to
it!&#8221;</p>
<p>But the boys found they need not have worried
about the matter of eating or sleeping. Competent
hands had the comfort of the soldiers in
charge and there was nothing lacking that could
be obtained. They were taken in charge by officers,
divided into squads, assigned to certain lifeboats,
and told where to report when an alarm
for a submarine attack, real or simulated, was
sounded.</p>
<p>Professor Snodgrass told how he had secured
permission to come aboard the transport with his
friends, the young soldiers&mdash;no easy matter&mdash;and
how he had been designated as a &#8220;correspondent,&#8221;
though Jerry Hopkins, on hearing this, remarked:</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose if he did send any news it would be
to the <i>Bug Hunter&#8217;s Review</i>, describing the life
of an insect on an army transport.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Very likely,&#8221; agreed Ned.</p>
<p>And so, amid the blaring whistle salutes of river
craft, the former German liner dropped down the
bay and started for France with the young soldiers
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_62' name='page_62'></a>62</span>
who were to do their part in ending barbarous
militarism forever.</p>
<p>It was not exactly a gay trip. There were many
who were seasick in spite of the calm weather, and
there was little to do on board. Only a few books
were available to read, and these were in constant
use. Aside from lifeboat drill there was
little to occupy the boys.</p>
<p>But there was always the fear of a submarine
attack when they should reach the infested zone,
and the boys looked forward to this as something
that would relieve the monotony.</p>
<p>There was a gun crew on the transport&mdash;several
of them, in fact&mdash;and the troop ships were
escorted by war vessels and the swift, snake-like
destroyers, which moved with such remarkable
speed.</p>
<p>One day, after the usual lifeboat drill, which
was held at different hours each day so that none
would suspect when it was coming, the three chums
were standing near the forward gun, rather idly
scanning the water. The night had been a dreary
one, cooped up as they were in the darkness, for
now that they were approaching the danger zone,
all but the most necessary lights were dimmed.</p>
<p>Up above, and on various parts of the deck,
were the lookouts, scanning with strained and
eager eyes the expanse of water ahead of them for
a sight of the white wake that would indicate a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_63' name='page_63'></a>63</span>
periscope, or, perchance, hoping to see the wet,
glistening sides of a &#8220;steel fish&#8221; itself, as it broke
water before sending the deadly torpedo.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, boys, how goes it?&#8221; asked a voice behind
the three chums, and they recognized Professor
Snodgrass.</p>
<p>As Jerry turned to speak to him, having finished
a remark in which he had speculated as to
what had become of Noddy Nixon, who was not
on board, one of the men cried:</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s that?&#8221;</p>
<p>He pointed to a spot about two points off the
port bow, and Ned, Bob and Jerry, as well as
several others, distinctly saw a little commotion
in the water.</p>
<p>&#8220;A sub, as sure as you&#8217;re a foot high!&#8221; cried
a marine, just as a bugle call to quarters was
blown, for a lookout, too, had observed the disturbance
in the water.</p>
<p>Instantly the gun crew was in action, and several
shots were fired from the bow gun. The reports
had hardly ceased echoing when some remarkable
activity was displayed, not only aboard
the transport, but on the part of the convoying
squadron.</p>
<p>As the shells splashed into the sea near the spot
where the commotion had been observed, there
were smudges of black smoke at several points on
either side of the troopship. These were the funnels
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_64' name='page_64'></a>64</span>
of the destroyers belching out clouds of vapor
that told of their approach under forced draught.
And as the other guns on the transport awoke and
began firing on the suspected submarine, up came
racing the swift craft, the men on board eagerly
looking for a target.</p>
<p>Then their big guns got into action, and for a
time the sea in the vicinity of the suspected place
was churned by exploding shells, while one destroyer,
the fastest of the flotilla, shot right over
the place where the lookout thought he had seen
a periscope, and dropped two depth bombs that
added further to the churning of Neptune&#8217;s element.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, for the second occasion in a short
time, lifeboat stations were sounded, and the soldiers,
donning their life preservers, took their
places to await what might follow&mdash;possibly, an
order to abandon ship after she had been struck
by a torpedo.</p>
<p>But this contingency did not arise. The destroyers
swarmed around the transport, seeking in
vain for something substantial on which to expend
their ammunition, and then the scare was
over.</p>
<p>And whether it was only a scare, or whether a
real submarine had shown her periscope and then
dived before sending a torpedo, could, of course,
only be surmised. But no chances were being
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_65' name='page_65'></a>65</span>
taken, and the transport on which the Cresville
boys traveled was not the only one of the American
Expeditionary Forces that believed itself the
object of a frustrated attack.</p>
<p>&#8220;If that was a sub, it came out pretty far to
meet us,&#8221; observed Jerry, when the excitement had
died away and they were at ease once more.</p>
<p>&#8220;No telling where they&#8217;ll be found,&#8221; said a noncommissioned
officer. &#8220;If that had been one I
believe we&#8217;d have got her, though.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Surest thing you know!&#8221; declared Ned Slade
emphatically.</p>
<p>This was the only incident that marked the passage.
Of course, at various times, especially during
the nights, the lookouts may have imagined
they saw the wake of a periscope or a torpedo,
but there was no general alarm.</p>
<p>And finally, after what really was a tiresome
voyage, and one the end of which was welcomed
by all, the transport docked at a certain port in
France, and Ned, Bob and Jerry were able, with
their water-weary comrades, to go ashore.</p>
<p>&#8220;Here at last!&#8221; murmured Jerry, as he and his
chums sought their own company.</p>
<p>&#8220;And where are the Huns we&#8217;re going to
fight?&#8221; asked Bob, looking around at the strange
scenes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, we won&#8217;t see them right away,&#8221; returned
Ned. &#8220;It&#8217;ll be more training camp for ours for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_66' name='page_66'></a>66</span>
a while. But we&#8217;ll see real fighting soon enough.
Don&#8217;t worry.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It can&#8217;t come any too soon for me, Buddy!&#8221;
exclaimed a tall, Southern lad, with whom the
Motor Boys had become chummy at Camp Dixton.
&#8220;Lead me to it!&#8221;</p>
<p>But there was much to be done before this
would occur. After the boys had disembarked
they were inspected, roll was called, and then they
were told to march to a designated depot, there
to eat and be fitted out for a march to the French
village where they were to be billeted until sent to
a training camp.</p>
<p>Professor Snodgrass could not, of course, stay
with the army boys, but he announced that he
would follow them as closely as possible, and keep
in communication with them. As soon as might
be he would arrange to begin the search for the
two missing girls.</p>
<p>Not all that Ned, Bob and Jerry had read of
the gigantic work undertaken to fit out and maintain
the American armies in France prepared them
for what they saw. The port where the transport
docked had been transformed. Great storehouses
and warehouses were erected. Whole railway
systems had been built, with the American locomotives
replacing the diminutive French ones. And
the French population and army representatives
were as much surprised at the initiative and wonderful
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_67' name='page_67'></a>67</span>
progress of the American forces as were
the new recruits themselves.</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, we&#8217;re going into this war with both feet!&#8221;
exclaimed Jerry admiringly.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the only way to do it,&#8221; said Ned. &#8220;The
harder we go at it the sooner it will be over.&#8221;</p>
<p>They had their &#8220;chow,&#8221; and even Bob admitted
that it was &#8220;mighty good,&#8221; and, as you
know, he was a connoisseur.</p>
<p>Then, with their comrades, the three Motor
Boys marched to the place where they were to
spend the night before going to the training camp.
This was a small French village, and its quaint
beauty, unspoiled by the Germans, was very attractive
to the sea-weary soldiers.</p>
<p>Ned, Bob and Jerry were billeted with five others
at a French farmhouse, where they were given
beds in the attic. The &#8220;beds&#8221; were only piles of
clean straw, but the lads were delighted with them
after their close bunks on the ship.</p>
<p>&#8220;I can roll over now without falling out,&#8221; said
Ned, with a sigh of comfort as he stretched out.</p>
<p>They drew their rations the following morning,
and breakfasted most heartily, if not luxuriously,
and were ready for what the day held for
them. This was nothing else than a journey to
their training camp, which, they learned, was
some miles behind the front lines where the fighting
was going on.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_68' name='page_68'></a>68</span></p>
<p>&#8220;But you&#8217;ll be moved up as fast as it&#8217;s possible
to do so,&#8221; said the officer who directed them.
&#8220;The fighting&#8217;s getting heavier and heavier.&#8221;</p>
<p>And this was true, for about this time the 42d
American Division was in position east of Rheims
where, a little later, a great German attack was
launched, and, as all the world now knows, was
flung back with disaster to the Hun forces.</p>
<p>The railroad journey, from a point near their
disembarkation port to their training camp, was
not a very comfortable one, as the troops had to
travel in cars that were used at times for horses.
But every one was in good spirits, and little inconveniences
were laughed at.</p>
<p>And finally, after three days, the welcome word
was given to leave the trains and march to the
camp. This was situated in a beautiful part of
France&mdash;that is, it had been beautiful before the
spoliation by the Huns, and there Ned, Bob and
Jerry, with thousands of their comrades, prepared
for the last phase of their training. Before
them was the enemy.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, here at last!&#8221; remarked Jerry, as he
eased himself from his pack, and, with his two
chums, stacked the guns together. &#8220;I wonder
what happens first?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Suppose you come over and have some chocolate?&#8221;
suggested a voice behind the boys, and,
turning, they saw a pleasant-faced young man,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_69' name='page_69'></a>69</span>
whose hair, however, was gray. He wore a semi-military
uniform, but a glance at his sleeve showed
the red triangle, and the letters &#8220;Y. M. C. A.&#8221;
were not needed to tell his character.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come over and make yourselves at home,&#8221; he
went on. &#8220;You&#8217;ll have time before you&#8217;ll be
called on to report.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you, we will,&#8221; said Jerry. &#8220;Some
chocolate would touch the spot.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve got two spots that need touching,&#8221;
laughed Bob.</p>
<p>&#8220;Won&#8217;t you boys come, too?&#8221; invited the Y. M.
C. A. worker, as he turned to some others who
had marched up as Ned, Bob and Jerry were moving
away.</p>
<p>&#8220;What? Trail in with a lot of psalm-singing
goody-goodies?&#8221; was the sneering retort of one,
and it needed only a glance to show that the
speaker was Noddy Nixon.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s here&mdash;worse luck!&#8221; murmured Ned.</p>
<p>&#8220;No Y. M. C. A. for mine!&#8221; sneered Noddy.</p>
<p>&#8220;Boor!&#8221; muttered Bob, in protest.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is a Knights of Columbus station next
to ours, and a Salvation Army hut, as well as a
Jewish Community station, here in camp,&#8221; was
the gentle answer of the secretary. &#8220;If you prefer
one of those you will be very welcome, I
know. We are all working together for you
boys.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_70' name='page_70'></a>70</span></p>
<p>&#8220;None for mine!&#8221; sneered Noddy. &#8220;I want
some cigarettes!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I can let you have some at my <i>foyer</i>,&#8221; said the
secretary, with a smile. &#8220;I don&#8217;t smoke myself,
but I like the smell of it mighty well. Come
along.&#8221;</p>
<p>But Noddy laughed sneeringly, and would not
go. However, Ned, Bob and Jerry accompanied
the Y. M. C. A. man, and very glad they were to
buy, at a modest price, some cups of chocolate,
and also some cakes of it to put in their pockets.</p>
<p>&#8220;These Y. M. C. A. and K. C. places are all
to the merry!&#8221; voted Ned. &#8220;They were great
back at Camp Dixton, but they&#8217;re twice as good
here!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And we&#8217;ll look after you, as well as we can,
when you get on the firing line,&#8221; said their new
friend. &#8220;You&#8217;ll have to depend on the Salvation
Army lassies for doughnuts, but we can give you
smokes and chocolate almost any time. Have
some more!&#8221;</p>
<p>He made the boys and their comrades so welcome
that they hated to leave to go to roll call.
But this must be done, and soon they were assigned
to barracks, much the same as in Camp
Dixton.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>
<h3>ON THE FIRING LINE</h3>
</div>
<p>The training Ned, Bob and Jerry went through
in the French camp, though on a more intense
scale and with greater attention to detail, was
much like that which they had obtained at Camp
Dixton, and that has been related at length in the
volume preceding this.</p>
<p>There were the same drills to go through, only
they were harder, and in charge were men who
had seen terrible fighting. Some of them were
American army officers, sent back from the front
to instruct the new recruits, and others were
French and British officers, detailed to teach the
raw troops who, at first, were brigaded with the
veterans.</p>
<p>It was rise early in the morning, drill hard all
day, attend some school of instruction in the evening,
and then, after a brief visit perhaps to the
Y. M. C. A. hut or one of the other rest tents, go
to bed, to get up and do it all over again the next
day.</p>
<p>But the boys never felt it monotonous, nor did
they complain of the hard work. They knew it
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_72' name='page_72'></a>72</span>
was necessary, and here on the very fighting
ground itself&mdash;in wonderful France&mdash;there was
a greater incentive to apply oneself to the mastering
of the lessons of the war.</p>
<p>Then, too, they saw or heard at first hand of
the indescribable cruelties and atrocities of the
Huns. Ned, Bob, Jerry, and their comrades saw
with what fervor the French and British were
proceeding with the war, and their own spirits
were inflamed.</p>
<p>No work was too hard for them, from learning
to throw hand grenades, taught by men who
had had them thrown at them, to digging trenches
laid out after the fashion of those on either side
of No Man&#8217;s Land. Then came small sham engagements,
when, imagining the sample trenches
to be held by Germans, a company would storm
them to drive out the &#8220;enemy.&#8221;</p>
<p>In fair and rainy weather this work went on,
and it rained more often than not, as Jerry wrote
home to his mother. The chums could write, but
there was no telling when the missives would be
delivered, nor when they would get any in return,
for there was such congestion that the mail service
broke down at times, and no wonder. So, though
eventually the home folks&mdash;and in them is included
&#8220;the girls&#8221;&mdash;got all the mail intended for them,
there were days of anxious waiting.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the Motor Boys were perfecting
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_73' name='page_73'></a>73</span>
themselves as soldiers, and were winning the commendation
of their officers. Jerry was promoted
to be first corporal, and in his squad of seven were
Ned and Bob, much to their delight.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a pleasure to take orders from you, old
man,&#8221; said Ned.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I won&#8217;t give any more than I have to,&#8221;
remarked the tall lad, now taller and more
bronzed than ever.</p>
<p>Professor Snodgrass had managed to find quarters
in a village not far from camp, and from
there he came to see the boys occasionally. He
was getting his affairs in shape to proceed with
the study of the matter at present under his attention.</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you heard anything from Miss Petersen
or Miss Gibbs?&#8221; asked Jerry.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, not a word,&#8221; was the answer. &#8220;I have
sent several letters, and made inquiries of the
authorities here, but the latter give me very little
encouragement. That&#8217;s bad, too; for I&#8217;ve just
had word from home that makes my share in
that inheritance seem of more importance than
ever,&#8221; and the professor gave a little sigh.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, what&#8217;s happened, Professor?&#8221; questioned
Jerry, with quick sympathy.</p>
<p>&#8220;I lent some money,&#8221; explained Professor
Snodgrass, &#8220;to one of my friends&mdash;an old friend
with whom I went through college&mdash;to help him
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_74' name='page_74'></a>74</span>
over a hard place. But he has not got over his
troubles; in fact, his affairs are growing worse,
and it looks as if I would never get my money
back. And that will cripple me, cripple me badly,
boys. Yes, I need the money that Professor
Petersen was good enough to leave me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, let&#8217;s hope that you find those girls
quickly, Professor, and get that inheritance very
soon,&#8221; said Ned.</p>
<p>&#8220;But I am afraid I shall have to wait until you
boys capture Germany, and then I can go in and
search.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Us boys&mdash;with help,&#8221; chuckled Jerry.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, if it keeps up the way we&#8217;ve started
we&#8217;ll soon have the Hun on the run!&#8221; declared
Ned, and he spoke with some truth, for soon was
to be the beginning of the successful American advance.</p>
<p>Greatly to their relief the boys saw little of
Noddy Nixon, for he was housed in barracks at
the opposite end of the camp from those in which
they were billeted. But they met him occasionally,
and listened with ill-concealed disgust to his
boasts, and his talk of having tried in vain to enlist
before he was drafted.</p>
<p>&#8220;If they&#8217;d give me an aeroplane I&#8217;d go over the
German lines and make &#8217;em sit up and take notice!&#8221;
boasted the bully.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why don&#8217;t you send home for what&#8217;s left of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_75' name='page_75'></a>75</span>
your &#8216;<i>Tin Fly</i>&#8217;?&#8221; asked Ned, with a wink at his
chums.</p>
<p>&#8220;Aw, you dry up!&#8221; commanded Noddy, for this
airship, which he had once built to compete in an
exhibition, was a sore point with him, as it had not
justified its name.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, all along the line in the sector
where the American troops were stationed hard
fighting was going on. On either flank were
French and English forces, but the boys of Uncle
Sam were holding up their end of the work exceedingly
well.</p>
<p>&#8220;When can we get into it?&#8221; sighed Ned one
evening, when reports came in of heavy fighting,
during which certain American units had won distinction.</p>
<p>&#8220;Very soon, so I hear,&#8221; returned Jerry. &#8220;Our
intensive training is nearly over. We may be
moved up to the front any day now.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The sooner the quicker,&#8221; cried Bob. &#8220;Maybe
the eats won&#8217;t be so good farther front, but we&#8217;ll
see some action!&#8221;</p>
<p>Of course, there had been &#8220;action&#8221; in plenty at
camp, but it was of the safe variety, and this did
not appeal to the boys.</p>
<p>Then their chance came. One morning after
drill emotion, like electricity, seemed to run
through the camp.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s up?&#8221; came the queries from all sides.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_76' name='page_76'></a>76</span></p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re ordered to the firing line!&#8221; was the answer.</p>
<p>And then came cheers! Cheers that showed of
what stuff America&#8217;s fighters were made.</p>
<p>The news proved true. That evening, under
the cover of darkness, so that no lurking Hun
planes might detect the movement, a considerable
body of troops from the training camp was sent
up toward the front, to relieve some battle-scarred
units.</p>
<p>At first, as the three chums and their comrades
marched along, there was joking and laughing.
Then this died away. The seriousness of the situation
began to be comprehended. It was not
that any one was afraid. The boys were realizing
the gravity of the occasion, that was all.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hark! what&#8217;s that?&#8221; asked Bob, as he
marched along with Ned, Jerry, as corporal, being
file leader. &#8220;Is it thunder?&#8221;</p>
<p>They stepped lightly so as to listen more intently.</p>
<p>&#8220;The guns!&#8221; explained a lieutenant hurrying
past. &#8220;Those are the guns on the firing line you
hear. There must be a night attack.&#8221;</p>
<p>The guns of the front! Fighting was actually
very near, for, though the boys in camp had often
heard a distant rumble when there was a big
bombardment on, this was the first time they had
heard so plainly the hostile guns. It gave them
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_77' name='page_77'></a>77</span>
a thrill, even as they felt the ground tremble beneath
them.</p>
<p>And so, in the darkness, they moved up to
their new camp&mdash;a camp on the very edge of the
fighting; and from where they came to a halt, to
wait for morning before being assigned to the
trenches, they could see the lurid fires that flared
across No Man&#8217;s Land.</p>
<p>Tired and weary, but with an eagerness nothing
could subdue, the chums and their comrades
awoke the next morning as the bugle called them.
At first they could not realize where they were,
and then with a rush it came to them.</p>
<p>&#8220;On the firing line!&#8221; cried Jerry. &#8220;Just where
we wanted to be! Now for some action!&#8221;</p>
<p>Hardly had he spoken when there sounded a
terrific explosion, and the boys were fairly blown
off their feet, toppling to the ground.</p>
<p>There was action for them!</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>
<h3>IN THE TRENCHES</h3>
</div>
<p>Stunned and bruised, the three chums and
several of their comrades around them were incapable
of action for a little while. Then, as
Jerry raised himself from the ground, he heard
Bob ask:</p>
<p>&#8220;What hit us, anyway? Are the Germans attacking?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Gee!&#8221; was Bob&#8217;s muttered protest.</p>
<p>&#8220;Get up!&#8221; some one cried. &#8220;You&#8217;re all right.
It was a bomb from a Hun plane, but it missed
its mark.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Seems to have hit me all right,&#8221; observed Ned,
whose face was bleeding, though only from
scratches.</p>
<p>&#8220;You were knocked down by the concussion,&#8221;
explained the officer who had told them to get up.
&#8220;It was a close call all right, but no one is hurt.
Fall in for roll call!&#8221;</p>
<p>Ned, Bob, Jerry, and some of the other soldiers
scrambled to their feet. They had been on
the point of answering roll call when the explosion
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_79' name='page_79'></a>79</span>
came, and now that the danger was over, at least
for the time being, they had a chance to see what
had caused it.</p>
<p>The aeroplane from which the bomb had been
dropped was not now in sight, but this is what had
happened. One of the German machines passing
over the front line, as they often did, had escaped
the Allied craft, and had also managed to pass
through the firing of the anti-aircraft guns.
Whether the machine had gone some distance
back, hoping to drop bombs on an ammunition
dump, or whether it came over merely to take a
pot shot at the American trenches, was never
known.</p>
<p>But the aviator had dropped a large explosive
bomb, which, luckily for the Motor Boys and their
comrades, had fallen into an open space, though
not far from one of the camouflaged stations
where the soldiers were quartered before being
taken up to the front-line trenches. The explosion
had blown a big hole in the ground and damaged
some food stores, but that was all, except that
when the Americans were about to answer roll
call they were knocked down by the concussion,
and some, like Ned, were scratched and cut by
flying dirt and stones, or perhaps by fragments of
the bursting bomb.</p>
<p>&#8220;See, no one is hurt,&#8221; went on the officer, as if
to reassure those who were soon to take their
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_80' name='page_80'></a>80</span>
places in the front-line trenches. &#8220;Good luck was
with you that time.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope it keeps up,&#8221; murmured Bob. &#8220;It&#8217;s a
mean trick to shoot a man before he has his
breakfast,&#8221; and then he wondered why the others
laughed.</p>
<p>They all looked curiously, and it may be said,
thankfully, at the big hole made by the bomb. As
the officer had said, only good luck had prevented
some of the boys from filling that hole.</p>
<p>After this Jerry was silent and thoughtful.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, what&#8217;s next?&#8221; asked Ned, after an examination
had shown that his wounds were merely
scratches, for which he refused to go to the hospital,
or even a dressing station.</p>
<p>&#8220;Breakfast, I hope,&#8221; said Bob, and this it
proved to be.</p>
<p>The excitement caused by the dropping of the
bomb soon died away, though Ned, Bob, Jerry,
and some of the other soldiers who had not yet
been under hostile fire, felt their nerves a bit unsteady
for some time.</p>
<p>But the veterans, of whom there were many,
appeared to take it as a matter of course. It had
happened before, they said, and probably would
again.</p>
<p>&#8220;But that&#8217;s what we came here for&mdash;war,&#8221; remarked
Jerry, as he and his chums finished their
breakfast&mdash;no very elaborate meal, and one to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_81' name='page_81'></a>81</span>
which little time was given. &#8220;We&#8217;ve got to take
our chances.&#8221;</p>
<p>Up and down the line, on either side of the
sector where the three chums were to receive their
baptism of fire, already begun, could be heard dull
booming. It was the firing of heavy guns, and
might indicate an attack in progress or one being
repelled by either side. Here the Allied and German
lines were close together, in some places the
front-line trenches being less than six hundred
feet apart. Between was the famed and terrible
No Man&#8217;s Land.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wonder if Professor Snodgrass will ever get
up as far as this,&#8221; mused Ned, as they prepared
to go back to their quarters and begin the day&#8217;s
business.</p>
<p>&#8220;The firing wouldn&#8217;t keep him away, if he
thought he could find some bugs,&#8221; answered Jerry.
&#8220;And if he wants to ascertain the effect of noises
on crickets all he has to do is to bring the crickets
here. We can supply the noise.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I should say so!&#8221; agreed Bob. &#8220;It&#8217;s getting
worse, too! Listen to that!&#8221;</p>
<p>Indeed, with the broadening of day the noise
of the big and small guns increased. Whether a
great battle was impending or merely local engagements,
the boys had no means of knowing.</p>
<p>The position to which they had been brought,
and where they would spend about a week, holding
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_82' name='page_82'></a>82</span>
the front and supporting line trenches, until
relieved by a new command, ran up and over a
little wooded hill. From this vantage point, which
had more than once been stormed in vain by the
Germans, could be seen the country beyond No
Man&#8217;s Land&mdash;a portion of France held by the
enemy. And in the brief glimpse the Motor Boys
had of it, smoke-covered and stabbed with flashes
of fire here and there as it was, they saw something
of what war meant.</p>
<p>&#8220;The professor is going to have some job on
his hands if he expects to find any young ladies
on the other side of that,&#8221; and Ned waved his
hand to indicate the terrain possessed by the
Huns.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, we can get through if we attack in force,&#8221;
declared Bob. &#8220;And maybe that&#8217;s why they
brought us up&mdash;there may be going to be an attack.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll have to get through&mdash;for objects big
and little; that the professor may find his girls
and his inheritance and,&#8221; and here Ned&#8217;s lips set
a little grimly, &#8220;that we may help to bring back
freedom to the earth.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There may be an attack all right, if Foch,
Pershing and the other generals think it&#8217;s a good
time for it,&#8221; said Jerry. &#8220;But as for having it
postponed until our arrival, well, you boys have
some ideas of your ability.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_83' name='page_83'></a>83</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I didn&#8217;t mean that!&#8221; cried Bob. &#8220;I meant
that maybe we&#8217;d be in the big battle.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope we are,&#8221; said Ned. &#8220;We want to do
our share.&#8221;</p>
<p>This opportunity soon came to the boys. As
soon as they reached their headquarters&mdash;a series
of ruined buildings in which they had passed the
night&mdash;they were told to get ready to go up and
take their places in the trenches. But first they
were given a little talk by one of the officers, who
explained the necessity of donning gas masks at
the first alarm. Other instructions were given,
and then, when it was seen that every man had
everything he needed, from the first-aid kit to the
grotesque-looking gas mask, the trip to the first-line
trenches was begun.</p>
<p>So much has been written about the World War
that it seems needless to explain anything about
the trenches. As all know, they were a series of
ditches, about six feet deep, dug along in front
of similar ditches constructed by the enemy. The
distance between the two lines of trenches varied
from a few hundred feet to several thousand.</p>
<p>The ditches, or trenches, were not in straight
rows. They zig-zagged to make attacks on them
more difficult. There were several rows of
trenches on both sides of No Man&#8217;s Land. This
was so that in the event of an attack the men
could fall back from one line of trenches to the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_84' name='page_84'></a>84</span>
other, fighting meanwhile to drive off the enemy.</p>
<p>The trenches were narrow, about wide enough
for one man, though two might pass by squeezing.
At intervals, however, were wider places where
food or wound-dressing emergency stations could
be established. At other places there were large
excavations where dugouts were constructed, and
there relief parties rested and slept if they could
between periods of duty.</p>
<p>The bottoms of some of the trenches were covered
with &#8220;duck boards,&#8221; or short planks, with
spaces between to let the water run out, and in
certain parts of France it seemed to some of the
boys to rain about three hundred out of the three
hundred and sixty-five days of the year.</p>
<p>The trenches were sometimes braced with
boards and cross pieces of wood, such as is often
used when a sewer is dug through the streets, and
again wicker-work, or jute bagging, might be
used to hold the earth firm.</p>
<p>Below the top of the trenches, in certain places,
were projections. These were firing steps, and
the men stepped up on these to aim their rifles at
the enemy. In certain other places were set up
improvised periscopes, so that an officer could
look &#8220;over the top,&#8221; and, by a series of reflecting
mirrors, observe what was going on in the enemy&#8217;s
country.</p>
<p>Again, at other places in the trenches, light
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_85' name='page_85'></a>85</span>
artillery, such as machine guns and grenade
throwers were set up. Here and there were little
stoves to warm the food brought up whenever a
relief party could get through the rain of shells.
In some places heavy concrete or wooden dugouts
were constructed, well under ground, though
the Germans did more of this than the Allies, the
Hun trenches being very elaborate at times.</p>
<p>And it was to these trenches that Ned, Bob and
Jerry, with their comrades, were led. There they
would remain on duty for a specified time differing
under varying conditions, or until an attack was
either made by them or by the enemy. After
that, in case the enemy were successful, trenches
farther in the rear must be occupied. But in the
event of the German attack being repulsed, and a
counter-attack carrying the Allies forward, advanced
trenches&mdash;possibly those deserted by the
Huns&mdash;would be used.</p>
<p>&#8220;Forward!&#8221; came the command, and the three
Motor Boys advanced. They did not march long
in open formation. To do this would be dangerous,
within range of the German guns as they
were, and, too, they might be seen by a Hun observer
in an aeroplane. So, in a little while the
advancing squad, of which Ned, Bob and Jerry
formed a part, found itself in a communicating
trench. This was a ditch dug at right-angles to
the front-line trenches, and through this the relief
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_86' name='page_86'></a>86</span>
passed, and food and ammunition were brought
up.</p>
<p>The communicating trench zig-zagged, as did
the front-line ones, to provide greater safety, and
the boys finally gave up trying to guess in which
direction they were going. All they could see was
the sky above their heads.</p>
<p>Suddenly, however, the trench widened, and
they saw another crossing it. At this point, too,
there was what seemed to be a rough door, made
of planks nailed together.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is your dugout,&#8221; said the leading officer,
indicating that Ned, Bob and Jerry, with some
others, were to remain there, while he led the rest
farther on.</p>
<p>&#8220;Glad you&#8217;ve come,&#8221; remarked a haggard-looking
officer, who was to be relieved by the commander
of the squad in which were the three
chums.</p>
<p>&#8220;Has Fritz been bothering you?&#8221; asked Lieutenant
Anderson, who was in charge of the relief.</p>
<p>&#8220;Has he? Well, rather! And then some!
You have my permission to stay as long as you
please! Come on, boys!&#8221; and he led his war-weary
men back to a rest billet.</p>
<p>&#8220;Make yourselves at home, fellows,&#8221; said the
lieutenant. &#8220;And wipe your feet before you come
in,&#8221; he added with a laugh, as he looked down at
his muddy boots.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_87' name='page_87'></a>87</span></p>
<p>The passwords had been given and received.
The other relief party had passed on to allow
other worn-out men to get some rest. Ned, Bob
and Jerry looked about them. They were in a
dirt ditch, filled here and there with puddles of
water from the last rain, and the clouds still hung
in the sky.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where are the German trenches?&#8221; asked Ned.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where? Right in front of us&mdash;over there,&#8221;
and the lieutenant pointed. &#8220;Wait, I&#8217;ll show you,
and everybody get this, and take a lesson from
it!&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>He held up a steel helmet on the end of a
stick. In an instant it went spinning off and fell
at his feet in the trench. He picked it up, pointing
grimly to a neat little hole through it and
said:</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what will happen to any one of you
if he sticks his head up. You&#8217;re in the front-line
trench. Don&#8217;t forget it!&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>
<h3>A NIGHT PATROL</h3>
</div>
<p>Every one who saw the heavy steel hat so
neatly pierced by the swift bullet was impressed
by the object lesson, as the lieutenant had intended
all of them should be. But, somehow or other,
Bob Baker seemed more fascinated than either
of his chums, and, indeed, more than any other
member of that particular relief squad.</p>
<p>&#8220;Did a Hun bullet do that?&#8221; asked Bob, as he
picked up the head protector and looked at the
hole.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what it did, my boy,&#8221; answered the
officer. &#8220;And that&#8217;s what will happen to you, or
any one else, if you stick your head up above the
trench.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And the Huns did that!&#8221; murmured Bob, who
seemed not to be able to efface from his mind the
picture of the punctured, spinning helmet. &#8220;Then
we&#8217;re right within range of their fire.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Considerably so,&#8221; answered the lieutenant.
&#8220;In places the German trenches are only six hundred
feet away, and that&#8217;s nothing for the modern
rifle. It can kill at over a mile.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_89' name='page_89'></a>89</span></p>
<p>&#8220;So, Chunky,&#8221; observed Jerry, &#8220;you&#8217;ve been
under fire now.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Bob, and his voice was sober,
&#8220;we&#8217;ve been under fire.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course this isn&#8217;t anything!&#8221; the lieutenant
exclaimed with a laugh, as he kicked aside the
bullet-punctured helmet Bob had dropped. &#8220;This
is just a little byplay. You&#8217;ll be under heavier
fire than this, but don&#8217;t worry. It takes a good
many bullets to get a man. However, don&#8217;t think
of that. Do your duty. That&#8217;s what you&#8217;re here
for!&#8221;</p>
<p>The lieutenant looked somewhat anxiously into
the faces of the relief squad he was to command.
Every officer likes to know that he has the bravest
of men in the army, and this young officer was no
exception. The firing line where the Motor Boys
now were&mdash;the front-line trenches&mdash;was no place
for cowards.</p>
<p>But the faces that looked back into the young
lieutenant&#8217;s gave no reflection of fear. And at
this he breathed in relief. There was puzzled
wonder on the countenance of some, and grim
determination on others, and this last was what
counted.</p>
<p>And then began for the Motor Boys and their
chums a life of the utmost tension, strenuousness,
and danger, although theirs was a comparatively
quiet sector at that particular stage of the war,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_90' name='page_90'></a>90</span>
and they were holding the trenches more to guard
against a surprise attack than anything else.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, there&#8217;s one comfort,&#8221; remarked Jerry,
as he was placed in his station in the trench, with
Bob on one side and Ned on the other, both within
talking distance.</p>
<p>&#8220;What?&#8221; asked Bob. &#8220;Do we get better eats
here?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Eats, you heathen!&#8221; exclaimed Ned. &#8220;Can&#8217;t
you forget that once in a while? What are you
going to do if the Germans make you a prisoner?
They won&#8217;t feed you at all!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then I won&#8217;t be a prisoner!&#8221; declared Bob.
&#8220;But what were you going to say about comfort,
Jerry?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t have to drill,&#8221; was the answer.</p>
<p>And this was true. All the life of the camp
was now done away with, even the training camp
of France, where the boys had finished their war
education, so to speak. But if they did not have
to drill there was plenty else to occupy them.</p>
<p>While on duty in the trench they had constantly
to be on the alert, and this not to guard against
the unexpected approach of some friendly officer,
bent on determining how his sentries were performing
their duty, but to be on the watch against
the approach of a deadly enemy. There must be
no sleeping&mdash;not even dozing&mdash;on post.</p>
<p>Then, too, there was work to do. There was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_91' name='page_91'></a>91</span>
food and water to bring up, and fire wood to
scurry for when the chance offered, for it was not
often possible to bring up hot rations to the front
lines, and the boys heated their own as best they
could, in discarded tin cans with a few twigs for
fuel.</p>
<p>There were lines of trenches to cut, dugouts
to repair after they had been blown to bits by
the German guns, and there was barbed wire to
replace under cover of darkness when it had been
severed by the rain of steel and lead from the
enemy&#8217;s guns.</p>
<p>So the three chums and their comrades found
no lack of things to keep them busy in the
trenches. They had their hours off, of course,
when they were permitted to go back to the dugout,
and there, in comparative safety, they might
try to sleep. This was not easy, for though in
a manner they became used to the constant roaring
and blasting of the big guns, there was always
an under-current of disturbances of other kinds.
They were on the firing line, and the enemy did
not let them forget it.</p>
<p>Every day the aeroplanes went over the lines,
and more than once there was a battle in mid-air
above where Ned, Bob and Jerry were on duty.
Once a Hun plane came down in flames, so near
they could hear the thud as it struck.</p>
<p>At times, after a period of comparative quiet,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_92' name='page_92'></a>92</span>
the trenches on both sides of No Man&#8217;s Land
would suddenly awaken into life. This would be
caused by a fear, either on the part of the Germans
or the troops from America, that one or the
other was starting a raid. Then the machine guns
would open fire, they would be augmented by the
rifles of the men, and, if the shooting kept up long
enough, the rival batteries would awaken and the
big guns would speak.</p>
<p>It was one day, when the three chums had been
on duty in the front-line trench about a week, that,
as they were talking about the chance of seeing
Professor Snodgrass and helping him in his search
for the two girls, something spun past Ned&#8217;s
head with a whine, and, with a vicious ping, imbedded
itself in the trench wall behind him.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s that?&#8221; exclaimed Bob.</p>
<p>&#8220;That sniper again,&#8221; answered Ned. &#8220;That&#8217;s
the closest he&#8217;s come. We&#8217;d better move, fellows,
or he may get one of us.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A sniper!&#8221; exclaimed Jerry. &#8220;Has he been
taking pot shots at you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Several of &#8217;em. I&#8217;ve tried to get him, but I
can&#8217;t figure out where he hides. Better move
down the trench a bit. He seems to train his gun
on this particular spot.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Gee!&#8221; gasped Bob.</p>
<p>Bob and Jerry had moved up from their own
stations to where Ned was placed, as it was a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_93' name='page_93'></a>93</span>
quiet period of the day, and it was while they were
talking that the shot came.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d like to have a try at him,&#8221; said Jerry. &#8220;It&#8217;s
queer he can send a bullet down into this trench.
It must come from above. A shot from the German
trenches wouldn&#8217;t reach here over the top,
unless it was fired up, and landed here as it came
down.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then it would be a spent ball,&#8221; argued Bob,
&#8220;and it wouldn&#8217;t sing out the way that one did.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re right,&#8221; agreed Ned. &#8220;It was fired
from above&mdash;you can tell that by the slant it took
as it came in. But it didn&#8217;t come from an aeroplane.
There hasn&#8217;t been any over the trench for
a long while. No, it&#8217;s some German sniper, and
he&#8217;s out there in the woods, I believe. Up a tree,
most likely, where he can fire down into our
trench. He must have a long-range rifle.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We ought to try to get him,&#8221; argued Jerry.
&#8220;Have you, Ned?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I&#8217;ve tried to bait him, so I could find out
where he shoots from and nip him in return, but
I haven&#8217;t been able to.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then I&#8217;m going to have a shot at him,&#8221; declared
Jerry, who was rated as an expert in the
use of the rifle, as his badge showed.</p>
<p>But his plan of getting revenge on the Hun,
who had so nearly shot Ned, was not destined to
be carried out at once. For just then the relief
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_94' name='page_94'></a>94</span>
of the boys came up, and they were marched back
to the dugout for a rest period.</p>
<p>It was after they had enjoyed this, and were
counting on again doing their turn in the trenches
that their chance came to go out on night patrol,
one of the most dangerous missions in the line of
duty.</p>
<p>So far, since the Motor Boys had come up to
the firing line, there had been no really serious
fighting in their immediate sector. On either side
of them there had been skirmishes, but a mile or
so away, so they had had no chance to participate.
Also there had been night raids, but Ned, Bob
and Jerry had not been in them.</p>
<p>This does not mean that Ned, Bob and Jerry
were in no danger, for, as has been shown, a bullet
came near ending Ned&#8217;s career. And aside from
this, there had been bombs dropped near them
from Hun aeroplanes, and once a whole portion
of the trench, just beyond where they were stationed,
had been caved in by a shell from a German
gun, and several brave lads had been killed,
while others were terribly injured. But Ned, Bob
and Jerry had come out unscathed.</p>
<p>Also there had been waves of gas&mdash;the ordinary
chlorine gas, and again the more dangerous
mustard variety. In fact, the Germans used their
yellow-cross and their green-cross gases alternately
against the sector where the Cresville chums were.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_95' name='page_95'></a>95</span>
But prompt use of the protective masks prevented
any casualties.</p>
<p>So, as has been said, when the three chums were
resting in the dugout, wondering what their next
duty would be, an officer came in, and, when he
had returned the salutes, he said:</p>
<p>&#8220;Volunteers are wanted for a raiding party to-night.
There&#8217;s a German dugout not far away,
and the commander thinks we have a good chance
to get some prisoners and thus learn a thing or
two about what Fritz is up to in this section.
There&#8217;s also a chance, as I needn&#8217;t mention, that
none of us will come back. Now then, who wants
to go?&#8221;</p>
<p>There was a moment of hesitation, and then,
to the credit of the young soldiers, every one
stepped forward.</p>
<p>&#8220;Um!&#8221; mused the officer. &#8220;I can&#8217;t use you all.
Thank you, just the same. Now let&#8217;s see,&#8221; and
he proceeded to pick out his squad.</p>
<p>To their delight Ned, Bob and Jerry were selected,
and at once began to prepare for the dangerous
mission. None of them gave more than
a passing thought to the reflection that all might
safely return or none of them come back.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>
<h3>BOB IS MISSING</h3>
</div>
<p>Careful preparations had been made for this
night raid. It was the constant effort of both
sides, during the period of trench fighting, to get
possession of facts which would allow successful
attacks to be carried out later. And to do this it
was needful to get close to the enemy&#8217;s line. By
so doing, certain things might be overheard in the
talk among the soldiers, or (for the results of the
listening were uncertain) better still, was the capture
of prisoners. Once they were taken back of
the lines, questioned and searched, much of value
might be obtained.</p>
<p>This, as a matter of fact, worked much better
for the Americans than it did for the Germans. If
the Huns did succeed in capturing, during a raid,
some of our boys, they got little information from
them about the units with which the boys of Uncle
Sam were connected. Nor did the Huns learn
much as to the strength of the forces opposed to
them, except, perhaps, in the way of exaggeration.</p>
<p>&#8220;The American captive is more inclined to utter
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_97' name='page_97'></a>97</span>
the equivalent of &#8216;nothing doing,&#8217;&#8221; remarked
Jerry, one day when discussing the matter.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the German prisoners captured,
almost invariably, were glad that their fate
had thus been ordered. They were sure of decent
treatment, they were in no more danger of being
killed and, more than anything else, they would be
better fed than in their own trenches.</p>
<p>So it is no wonder they gave valuable information
under the skilful questioning of the American
officers. Still this information had to be carefully
checked up before being acted on, as it would not
do to run into danger as a result of what some
Hun captive told.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are going out to try our luck,&#8221; explained
the lieutenant who was to lead Ned, Bob, Jerry,
and their comrades, numbering half a score, out
on a night raid. &#8220;There&#8217;s a German dugout not
far from here, and near by a machine-gun nest,
and if we can get close enough to rush it, and capture
those we don&#8217;t kill, we may make it possible
for a big forward movement&mdash;if the information
we get is of the right sort. So get ready. Gas
masks, hand grenades&mdash;rifles will be in the way&mdash;automatic
pistols, of course, and don&#8217;t forget to
blacken your faces.&#8221;</p>
<p>This precaution was always taken by night raiding
parties. The Germans adopted the habit of
sending up illuminating devices, known as &#8220;star
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_98' name='page_98'></a>98</span>
shells,&#8221; at frequent intervals over No Man&#8217;s
Land. This was to guard against a party of the
enemy advancing on the trenches. The shells
gave a very bright light, and nothing stands out
more conspicuously in such a glare than a white
face. So it was the custom to blacken countenances
and hands when a night-raiding party went
over the top.</p>
<p>It was not without a little feeling of nervousness
and apprehension that the three friends and
their chums made their preparations. But it was
an apprehension of failure rather than fear.
They wanted to succeed, to get results, and they
were afraid they might fail. They were not
afraid, personally. Still they were taking big
chances, and they all knew it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ought we to leave some word for Professor
Snodgrass?&#8221; asked Ned, as he and his friends
were making ready about midnight.</p>
<p>&#8220;Word about what?&#8221; Jerry inquired.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, in case we don&#8217;t come back we can&#8217;t help
him in his search, as we promised.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If we don&#8217;t come back our friends will know
it, and they can tell the professor if he inquires
for us,&#8221; said Jerry grimly. &#8220;Let it go at that. If
we get back we&#8217;ll be here ourselves in case the
professor ever gets this far to the front. If we
don&#8217;t get back&mdash;well, he&#8217;ll have to get some one
else to help him. Come on!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_99' name='page_99'></a>99</span></p>
<p>The last word was given, the final preparations
had been made. Then silently, like shadows of
the night, the figures crept out of the trench in the
darkness and advanced toward the German lines.</p>
<p>The American barbed wire had been cut in
places to let the party through. To pass the German
barrier they would have to do their own cutting,
and they were provided with tools for this
purpose.</p>
<p>Silently they went down the lane of wire, now
and then passing grim sentries to whom the password
was given. And then, coming to the gap in
the wire, Ned, Bob and Jerry, with the others,
passed through. Each member of the party carried
an automatic pistol and several hand grenades.
These were small, hollow containers, of
cast-iron, loaded with a powerful explosive, which
was set off after a certain trigger or spring or
firing pin (according to the type used) was released
by the thrower. The explosive blew the
grenade to bits, and it was scored, or crisscrossed,
by deep indentations so that the iron would break
up into small pieces like shrapnel. The grenades
could be carried in a pouch or in the pocket, and
were harmless as long as the detonating device
was not disturbed.</p>
<p>Silently the lieutenant led his men forward.
Jerry Hopkins, the only noncommissioned officer
in the squad, marched next, as in the event of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_100' name='page_100'></a>100</span>
lieutenant being killed the command would fall to
him.</p>
<p>No talking was permitted, and each man knew
what he was to do, so no orders were necessary.
On and on they went, and presently they found
themselves traveling over the battle-scarred and
shell-pitted territory of No Man&#8217;s Land. They
had got close to the German barbed wire when
suddenly, as though their movements had been
watched, several star shells were sent up by the
Huns.</p>
<p>Instantly every man in the party fell flat on his
face and did not move. It was the only thing to
do. They resembled, as nearly as they might,
the dead which lay all about them on the desolate
field.</p>
<p>And some of the dead had been there a long
time, as it was impossible for either side to bury
them, though occasionally, at night, parties went
out to bring in those in whom it was hoped a spark
of life still remained.</p>
<p>Jerry found that he had thrown himself down
close beside a dead Hun. He wanted desperately
to move, for his position was grimly unpleasant,
but he did not dare. This was not the most glorious
side of war, but it was vitally necessary.</p>
<p>However, thanks to the precaution of blackened
faces and hands, and to the dark uniforms,
the party of night-raiders must have resembled
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_101' name='page_101'></a>101</span>
the dead all about them, for no firing followed the
illumination of star shells.</p>
<p>Then, when it was dark again, the party rose
and went on. Good luck attended them thus far,
in that they reached the German barbed wire undiscovered.
Then began the ticklish work of cutting
it, and in this there was much danger.</p>
<p>For some of the wire was under great tension,
and, when cut, made a twanging sound like a
broken harp or piano string. And this sound carried
far in the silence of that sector. Other sectors
were not so quiet, for firing was going on
along both lines of trenches, though what movement
was under way the Motor Boys did not
know.</p>
<p>The sound of the wire as it was cut was deadened
as much as possible by having a man hold
the strand on either side of the place to be cut.
This helped some, but not always, as the wire
twisted itself from the grips of the soldiers, and
sometimes the barbs injured them.</p>
<p>&#8220;All cut, Lieutenant,&#8221; reported Jerry, as the
final strand was severed. The commanding officer
had been on watchful patrol while this was
being done.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good!&#8221; was the low-voiced answer. &#8220;Come
on, now. Every man with a grenade in either
hand!&#8221;</p>
<p>Once more the party went forward. They were
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_102' name='page_102'></a>102</span>
past the first German barbed wire now, but the
way was still not completely open, for more opposing
strands were found farther on. However,
this was not unexpected, for often three or more
lines of this American invention were to be found
opposing the American forces.</p>
<p>Once more the cutters were called into play,
and as the last strand was severed a dog, somewhere
within the Hun lines, barked. Instantly all
in the raiding party crouched down, for a burst
of star shells might follow immediately.</p>
<p>However, the dog must have been believed to
be a false alarmist, or else he was barking at some
other disturbance than that caused by the raiders,
for darkness still reigned.</p>
<p>Then, after waiting a moment to make sure all
was right, the lieutenant led his men forward. So
far they had not been challenged by the enemy,
but now this immunity was to end, for when they
had passed the final wire barrier and were advancing
with tense steps toward the German dugout,
with grenades in readiness, there came a
sharp, guttural order to halt.</p>
<p>It was in the German tongue, as they all knew,
and they all realized that the crucial moment had
come.</p>
<p>The lieutenant, seeing a figure in the darkness
before him, shot at it pointblank with his pistol.
There was a murmured exclamation, and the sentry
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_103' name='page_103'></a>103</span>
went down, his finger pressing the trigger of
his rifle, discharging it as he fell dead.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come on now, boys! Give it to &#8217;em!&#8221; cried
the officer.</p>
<p>&#8220;Forward!&#8221; shouted Jerry Hopkins, and with
Ned and Bob at his heels he rushed ahead, the
others stumbling after him. They had reached
the German trenches, and from them now poured
several defenders. The main body were in the
dugout a little farther on, and it was desired to
attack this, and, if possible, capture some prisoners.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come on! Come on! Down with the Huns!&#8221;
cried the lieutenant, and his battle yell was echoed
by Jerry and the others.</p>
<p>Then began a fight in the dark, the details of
which were never very clear to the Motor Boys.
Bob said he let loose all the grenades he had at
the advancing party of Germans and then rushed
at them, head down, as though advancing the ball
for a touchdown.</p>
<p>Ned declared that he fired his automatic pistol
until he realized that it was empty, and then,
throwing it away, thought for the first time of the
grenades he carried. Then he began using them.</p>
<p>There was a deafening noise as the grenades
of the Americans exploded in the faces of the advancing
Huns, and they, in turn, threw hand
bombs and opened fire with their rifles. The attack
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_104' name='page_104'></a>104</span>
awoke to life sentries and guard parties all
along the line, and the scene was illuminated by a
burst of star shells.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come on! Into the trenches! They can&#8217;t see
us there so well!&#8221; yelled Jerry.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the idea!&#8221; commanded the lieutenant.
&#8220;Get to the dugout!&#8221;</p>
<p>So desperate and sudden had been the attack of
the Americans that, after the first resistance, the
Germans gave way and ran back, jumping down
into the trenches whence they had come.</p>
<p>The raiding party asked nothing better than
to follow, and for a time pursued the Huns along
their own trenches, the bursting star shells above
giving light enough to see.</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you there&mdash;Ned&mdash;Bob?&#8221; demanded Jerry,
as he ran on, following the tortuous line of the
trench.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m here!&#8221; answered Ned.</p>
<p>&#8220;So&#8217;m I,&#8221; added Bob. &#8220;Haven&#8217;t a shot left,
though.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Here, take these,&#8221; and Jerry handed over
some spare grenades he had in a pouch slung at
his back. &#8220;Don&#8217;t pot any of our men, though.
Some are ahead of us.&#8221;</p>
<p>On ran the Motor Boys, and in another moment
they came to the dugout&mdash;a pretentious affair of
concrete, now well lighted, for the alarm of the
attack had spread.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_105' name='page_105'></a>105</span></p>
<p>One of the raiding party threw a hand grenade
inside the structure. There was a powerful explosion,
not enough, indeed, to wreck the stout
place, but sufficient to send the inmates scurrying
out&mdash;what were left of them.</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Kamerad! Kamerad!</i>&#8221; some of the wounded
ones cried, and others held up their hands.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come on!&#8221; shouted the lieutenant. &#8220;Gather
&#8217;em in and let&#8217;s get back. This place is getting too
hot for us.&#8221;</p>
<p>He spoke with truth, for on all sides the big
guns were now beginning to bark, and a general
engagement might be precipitated.</p>
<p>Some of the Americans snatched guns from the
now cowed Germans, and prodded them back
along the trench with the points of the bayonets.
Others held hand grenades or automatic pistols
ready, and the order to retreat was given.</p>
<p>Half a dozen Hun prisoners had been captured,
but at a price, for when the lieutenant, hurrying
his men back across No Man&#8217;s Land, began to
look over his party, he found three were missing.
They had either been killed or wounded, or were
left prisoners in the trenches.</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you there, boys?&#8221; asked Jerry again, of
his chums, and he received reassuring answers
from both.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hurt?&#8221; was his next inquiry, as they raced
across the stretch, stopping every time there was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_106' name='page_106'></a>106</span>
a burst of star shells, and crouching down, making
their prisoners do the same, to take shelter
in some shell holes, some half-filled with water
and others containing dead bodies.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m all right,&#8221; Bob answered. &#8220;Only a bit
scratched by some Hun&#8217;s bayonet, I guess.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A bullet or a bayonet touched me in the side,&#8221;
came from Ned. &#8220;It&#8217;s bleeding a bit, but not
much. I&#8217;m all right.&#8221;</p>
<p>Some of the others who were able to come back
were not so fortunate, however, and two died later
of wounds received in that night raid.</p>
<p>But the main party succeeded in getting back to
the American lines, and hurried through the opening
in the barbed wire, where a relief or a rescue
party, whichever might be required, was in waiting.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good work!&#8221; commended the captain to his
lieutenant. &#8220;And you got some prisoners?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Six!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s fine. Couldn&#8217;t be better. Get down
now, there may be a Hun barrage in a minute.
They&#8217;ll be ripping mad when they find out what&#8217;s
happened. This was one of their main posts, and
Prussians were on guard.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jerry and Ned were each guarding a Hun prisoner,
making him walk along ahead with upraised
hands, while the guns, taken away from the Germans
themselves, served as compelling weapons.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_107' name='page_107'></a>107</span></p>
<p>Into the trenches they had left a short time before
the raiders made their way, and went to the
dugout where they were to report. There the
commanding officer of that sector met them.</p>
<p>Coming into the comparatively well-lighted
place from the darkness, Jerry blinked as he
looked at the captured Germans and then glanced
to see how badly Ned was hurt.</p>
<p>He saw that his chum was pale, and noted blood
on his hands, but Ned smiled in a reassuring way.
Then, for the first time, Jerry noticed that Bob
was not with them.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;s Chunky?&#8221; he demanded.</p>
<p>&#8220;Who?&#8221; asked the lieutenant. &#8220;I thought we
only left Black, Jones, and Porter behind. Is
there another missing?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Bob Baker, sir,&#8221; answered Jerry. &#8220;But he
was with us when we got back within our own
wire. I was talking to him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Send out a searching party!&#8221; ordered the captain.
&#8220;It is possible he was hit and didn&#8217;t say anything
about it, or a stray bullet may have found
him after he reached our lines. Send out and
see!&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII</h2>
<h3>&#8220;JUST LIKE HIM!&#8221;</h3>
</div>
<p>Jerry and Ned both confessed, afterward, that
the sinking feeling, which seemed to carry their
hearts away down into their muddy shoes, was
greater at the knowledge that Bob was missing
than it had been when they set out in the darkness
to raid the Germans across the desolate stretch of
No Man&#8217;s Land.</p>
<p>It was all so unexpected. He had gone through
the baptism of fire with them&mdash;he had helped capture
the Huns&mdash;and had been, seemingly, all right
on the return trip. And then, on the very threshold
of his own army home, so to speak, he had disappeared.</p>
<p>&#8220;Did any one see him fall or hear of his being
hit?&#8221; asked the lieutenant, as he prepared to lead
out a searching party. Ned and Jerry, of course,
and by rights, would be members of it.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, he was right near me, Sir, and he said particularly,
when I asked him, that he was only
scratched,&#8221; declared Jerry. &#8220;I made sure Ned
was the worst hurt.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_109' name='page_109'></a>109</span></p>
<p>&#8220;How much are you hurt?&#8221; asked the captain,
turning to Jerry&#8217;s chum.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, it&#8217;s only a scratch, Sir,&#8221; was the quick
answer. &#8220;I can&#8217;t feel it now.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ned did not speak the exact truth, but he did
not want to be kept back from the search.</p>
<p>&#8220;Very well,&#8221; said the captain. &#8220;You may go,
but don&#8217;t go too far. Much as we would like to
find Baker we must not take too many chances
and endanger this whole post. Be as quick as you
can.&#8221;</p>
<p>With their hearts torn between a desire for
vengeance and apprehension, Ned and Jerry went
out with the others. The riot started by the raid
had quieted down, and it was possible for the
searchers to advance above their own trenches
without drawing the German fire.</p>
<p>First the sentries who had been on duty near
the gap in the American wire were questioned.
They had seen the party depart and come back,
but they had not noticed any member of it fall as
though wounded, and they were positive no Germans
had been able to get near enough to capture
Private Baker.</p>
<p>&#8220;But what can have happened to him?&#8221; asked
the lieutenant.</p>
<p>&#8220;He may have been wounded internally, and
didn&#8217;t speak of it, Sir,&#8221; suggested Ned, whose own
wound was troubling him woefully. &#8220;Then he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_110' name='page_110'></a>110</span>
may have become so weak that he fell in the trench
somewhere without a sound.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That is possible. We must make a careful
search.&#8221;</p>
<p>This was done with pocket flashlights, for any
general illumination would have, perhaps, drawn
a German attack. But no sign of Bob was revealed.
It was most mysterious, how he could
disappear so suddenly and completely. Of course,
in the general confusion, much more than this
might have happened and not been noticed. But
unless he had gone back after speaking to Jerry,
he must either have fallen well within the American
lines or have been captured there. And the
last did not seem possible.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said the lieutenant, &#8220;we&#8217;ll have to go
over in No Man&#8217;s Land and take a chance there.
He must have gone back after something, and
been potted. I&#8217;ll have to go back and report
and&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p>He paused to listen. The tramp of approaching
feet could be heard along the trench. Every
man stood at attention, for it was possible that
the enemy had slipped in between sentries and
were going to pay a return visit.</p>
<p>But a moment later the murmur of voices was
heard&mdash;voices that were unmistakably American.
Some one asked:</p>
<p>&#8220;Is your squad stationed here?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_111' name='page_111'></a>111</span></p>
<p>&#8220;About here, yes, Sir,&#8221; was the answer, coming
out of the darkness.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s Chunky!&#8221; cried Jerry.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s Bob!&#8221; added Ned, joyously.</p>
<p>And a moment later there came into the dim
light of the flashlights the stout chum himself,
escorted by three soldiers. He seemed to be all
right, and he carried something that was not a
grenade, in one hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where have you been, Chunky?&#8221; demanded
Jerry. &#8220;We&#8217;ve been looking everywhere for
you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; added the lieutenant, &#8220;will you please
explain why you did not report back with the rest
of us?&#8221;</p>
<p>Bob seemed a trifle surprised at the rather stern
order, but he smiled and answered:</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, I thought, as long as we got back all
right, I was relieved from duty, so I went to get
something to eat.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Something to eat!&#8221; exclaimed the lieutenant.</p>
<p>&#8220;Something to eat,&#8221; calmly repeated Bob.
&#8220;You see it was this way. I was terribly hungry&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing unusual,&#8221; murmured Jerry, but the
stout lad, paying no attention to the interruption,
went on:</p>
<p>&#8220;So when I got back with the rest, after we
captured the Huns, I smelled something cooking
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_112' name='page_112'></a>112</span>
farther up in our trenches. I knew some of the
fellows on duty there, and I felt sure they&#8217;d give
me something to eat. It was liberty links they
were cooking, sir, and&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Liberty links!&#8221; interrupted the lieutenant.
&#8220;What are those?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They used to be called Frankfurters,&#8221; explained
Bob with a grin; &#8220;but since the war that&#8217;s
too German. So I went to get some liberty links,
and I got &#8217;em!&#8221; he added with a sigh of satisfaction.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well! Well!&#8221; exclaimed the lieutenant. And
then, as he thought of what Bob and the others
had gone through with that night, he had not the
heart to add more.</p>
<p>&#8220;I only meant to run up in a hurry to where
they were cooking &#8217;em,&#8221; explained Bob, &#8220;and
come back with some for my bunkies. But I got
to talking and eating&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mostly eating,&#8221; murmured Jerry.</p>
<p>&#8220;And then I forgot to come back,&#8221; finished
Bob.</p>
<p>&#8220;We told him he&#8217;d better report, Sir,&#8221; said one
of the escorting party. &#8220;He was with our bunch
all right, and when he told us he&#8217;d been out with
the night raiders and had slipped off before reporting
back, we told him he&#8217;d better report. So
we showed him the way, as the trenches are sort
of mixed up around here.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_113' name='page_113'></a>113</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Very well,&#8221; said the lieutenant, trying not to
smile. &#8220;You may go back to your posts. Everything
is explained.&#8221;</p>
<p>And so Bob was restored to his company again,
and in view of the successful raid no reprimand
was given him. The capture of the German prisoners
proved important, as information was obtained
that proved of the greatest value afterward.</p>
<p>Ned&#8217;s wound turned out to be only a flesh one,
but it was painful enough, and kept him in the
hospital a week. He would have fretted over
thus being kept away while Bob and Jerry were
fighting, but, as a matter of fact, his two chums
received a rest period at this time, and so were
out of the trenches the same time that Ned was.</p>
<p>But the war was far from won, and every man
possible was needed on the firing line, so that, in
due season, the three chums found themselves back
again. And under no very pleasant circumstances.</p>
<p>For it rained and rained, and then rained some
more, though Jerry insisted that where they got
the water from was a mystery.</p>
<p>It was a most desolate period, when the trenches
were knee-deep in mud and when casualties
mounted by reason of unusual activity on the part
of the Huns. But the three friends and their comrades
stuck grimly to the work. There were local
attacks, and counter-attacks, and night raids, in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_114' name='page_114'></a>114</span>
all of which Ned, Bob and Jerry did their share.</p>
<p>Then, one day, they were given a surprise.
Some new recruits were brought up to the front-line
trenches, to be initiated, and among them was
Noddy Nixon.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve come to show you fellows how to get a
Hun!&#8221; he boasted in his usual style. &#8220;Give me a
chance, and I&#8217;ll show you how to fight, though I&#8217;d
rather be in an aeroplane.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Truth to tell, I guess he&#8217;d rather be back
home, but he doesn&#8217;t dare go,&#8221; declared Jerry.</p>
<p>Not very much to their delight, the Motor Boys
learned that Noddy was to be quartered near
them, and he was on duty in the trenches in the
post adjoining theirs.</p>
<p>There came a period of fierce attacks on the
part of the Huns, when they laid down such an
artillery barrage that for three days it was impossible
for any relief to come to the men in the
trenches, and they had to live on what food they
had when the firing began. They did not actually
starve, but there was not any too much to eat, and
there was a lack of hot things, which were much
needed as it rained almost constantly.</p>
<p>By hard work Ned, Bob and Jerry had managed
to get together some wood which they kept
dry in a niche in the trench, lined with pieces of
tin. The wood they used to make a little fire to
warm their coffee.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_115' name='page_115'></a>115</span></p>
<p>Coming in from several hours of duty one rainy
evening, the three chums were anticipating having
something hot to drink made over their little fire
of cached wood.</p>
<p>But when Bob, who by virtue of his appetite
considered himself the cook, went to get the fuel,
it was not there.</p>
<p>&#8220;Boys, the wood is gone!&#8221; he cried.</p>
<p>&#8220;Who took it?&#8221; demanded Jerry.</p>
<p>Ned inspected the place. He picked up a piece
of damp paper, and in the light of his flash torch
read the scrawled writing which said:</p>
<p style='margin-left:2.0em; margin-right:2.0em; '>&#8220;Borrowed your wood. Give it back to
you some day.</p>
<p style='margin-left:2.0em; margin-right:2.0em; text-align:right'>&#8220;<span style='font-variant:small-caps'>Noddy Nixon.</span>&#8221;<br /></p>
<p>For a moment there was silence, and then Jerry
burst out with:</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, if that isn&#8217;t just like him&mdash;the dirty
sneak!&#8221;</p>
<hr class='major' />

<a name='CHAPTER_XIV_A_DESPERATE_CHANCE' id='CHAPTER_XIV_A_DESPERATE_CHANCE'></a>
<h2>CHAPTER XIV</h2>
<h3>A DESPERATE CHANCE</h3>
</div>
<p>Disappointment rendered the three chums incapable
of action for the moment. They just
stood and looked at the place where their little
store of wood had been hidden. Now it was
gone, and with it the hope of a hot supper from
that particular source.</p>
<p>&#8220;What are we going to do?&#8221; asked Bob
blankly.</p>
<p>&#8220;We ought to go down to the post where that
sneak is and get the wood back,&#8221; declared Ned.
&#8220;And tell his chums what sort of fellow they have
bunking with &#8217;em!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, don&#8217;t do that,&#8221; advised Jerry, who had
cooled down after his first passionate outburst.
&#8220;That will make trouble. Noddy would only
laugh at us, and some of the others might. It
isn&#8217;t the first time wood has been taken.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I was just hungry for something hot,&#8221; sighed
Bob, as he thought of the cold rations.</p>
<p>&#8220;So was I,&#8221; added Ned. &#8220;Isn&#8217;t there anything
we can do?&#8221; he went on.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_117' name='page_117'></a>117</span></p>
<p>Jerry looked about. Here and there about the
dugout their comrades were eating as best they
could, no one, it appeared, having anything hot.
It was at a critical period during the fighting, and
the commissary and transportation departments
were suffering from a temporary breakdown. Still
the men had enough to eat, such as it was.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, we might as well have grub now&mdash;even
if it is cold,&#8221; said Jerry, after considering matters.
&#8220;No telling when we&#8217;ll have to stand off a
Hun raid or go into one ourselves, and then we
won&#8217;t have time to eat.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s so!&#8221; agreed Bob, more cheerfully. &#8220;It
would be fierce if we didn&#8217;t have anything to chew
on at all. But when I catch that Noddy Nixon&mdash;well,
he&#8217;d better watch his step, that&#8217;s all.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s a coward, and lazy!&#8221; declared Ned.
&#8220;Else he&#8217;d rustle his own wood. I had hard work
to get that bunch. There was a German sniper
who had a pretty fine bead on the place where I
saw the sticks, but I went down the trench a way,
and began firing at him from there.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you hit him?&#8221; asked Bob eagerly.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I didn&#8217;t expect to. But I drew his attention
to that particular spot. He thought a sharpshooter
was there, and he laid his plans to get him.
That took his attention off the pile of wood, and
I sneaked out and got it. Now Noddy Nixon has
it!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_118' name='page_118'></a>118</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I hope he burns his tongue on the hot soup or
coffee or whatever he heats with it,&#8221; was the most
charitable thing Jerry said. And the others
echoed this. Their nerves were on edge from the
constant fighting and danger they were in, and
they were in no mood to be trifled with. And at
such times trifles that otherwise would be laughed
at assumed large proportions.</p>
<p>However, there was no help for it. The three
chums, as did their comrades in the trenches, ate
their supper cold, and then, cleaning themselves
as best they could from the wet, sticky mud, they
prepared to get what sleep they might until it was
their turn to go on duty again.</p>
<p>The dugout was as comfortable as any of its
kind, but it was not like home, of course, and its
accommodations were far short of even the worst
camps the Motor Boys had put up at during their
many journeys. Still there was not a word of
complaint. It was war&mdash;war for freedom&mdash;and
discomforts were laughed at.</p>
<p>&#8220;Name of a name, how it rains! as our friends
the French say,&#8221; exclaimed Jerry, as he came into
the dugout prepared to turn in, for he had been
sent on a message by an officer after supper.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hard?&#8221; asked Ned, who, like Bob, was in a
sort of bunk.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hard? I should say so. Look; my tin hat is
dented from the drops!&#8221; and Jerry took it off and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_119' name='page_119'></a>119</span>
pretended to point out indentations made by the
rain drops. He shook his slicker, and a spray of
moisture flew about.</p>
<p>&#8220;Here! Quit that!&#8221; called a tall, lanky soldier
from the bunk across from Jerry. &#8220;If you want
to give a moving picture of a Newfoundland dog
go outside! I&#8217;m just getting dry.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Beg your pardon, old man!&#8221; exclaimed Jerry.
&#8220;I didn&#8217;t realize how wet I was.&#8221;</p>
<p>He took off some of his garments, hanging them
where they might possibly get partly dry by morning,
and then turned in. Whether he and his
chums would get a peaceful night&#8217;s sleep or not,
depended on the Huns across No Man&#8217;s Land. If
an attack was started it meant that the soldiers in
the dugouts, as well as those on guard in the
trenches, would have to jump into the fight. With
this end in view, every one on turning in for the
night had his weapons ready, and few did more
than make an apology for undressing. That was
left until they went on rest billet. Guns, grenades
and gas masks were in readiness for instant
use.</p>
<p>But the night passed undisturbed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, for some hot coffee!&#8221; exclaimed Bob, as
he tumbled out the next morning in answer to the
call to duty.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dry up!&#8221; ordered Jerry. &#8220;You ought to be
glad to get it cold!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_120' name='page_120'></a>120</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;ll try to be,&#8221; assented Bob. &#8220;Where&#8217;s
Ned?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Said he was going to see if he could get a bit
of wood for a fire. But if he finds any, which isn&#8217;t
likely, it&#8217;ll be as wet as a sponge after this rain.
Suffering hand grenades! will it ever let up?&#8221; cried
Jerry, for it was still pouring.</p>
<p>Simple preparations were going on for breakfast.
There was no sign yet of any of the carriers
with big kettles of hot coffee or soup, and it
was evident that the commissary had not yet been
reorganized since the last breakdown.</p>
<p>Afterward the boys learned that the reason for
the failure of their supplies to arrive was due to
the fact that their sector was temporarily cut off
by an attempted flanking movement on the part
of the Germans. The Americans were in greater
danger than they knew, but, at the time, all they
thought of was the lack of hot rations.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ned ought to come back,&#8221; remarked Jerry, as
he and Bob prepared to eat. &#8220;He&#8217;ll be reported
late, and this isn&#8217;t any time for that. I guess&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p>But Jerry did not finish, for just then came a
tremendous explosion, so close that for a moment
he and Bob thought a Hun shell had been dropped
in the dugout near which they were sitting under
an improvised shelter.</p>
<p>Instantly the trench was a scene of feverish activity.
Everyone expected a raid, and breakfast
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_121' name='page_121'></a>121</span>
was hastily set aside, while the soldiers caught up
their guns.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s all right,&#8221; an officer called. &#8220;Fritz just
took a pot shot at one of our trucks out on the
road.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Did he get it, Sir?&#8221; asked Jerry.</p>
<p>&#8220;I should say so! Look here!&#8221;</p>
<p>A curve in the road passed close by this line of
trenches. It was a road used to take supplies to
another part of the American battleline, and vehicles
passed along it only at night, as it was within
range of some of the German guns, though fairly
well camouflaged. But this auto truck, returning
in the early hours of the morning after having delivered
a load of ammunition, had been caught by
a shell. Afterward it was learned that the truck
had broken down on the return trip and that the
driver had been delayed in repairing it, so that
he had to pass the danger point in daylight.</p>
<p>Whether or not the German battery was on the
lookout for just such a chance as this, or whether
it was a mere fortuitous opportunity of which
advantage was taken, could not be learned. But a
shell containing high explosive, though, fortunately
for the driver, not a large one, landed near
the automobile and shattered it.</p>
<p>This was the detonation which had so startled
Jerry and Bob, and now, with others, they looked
over the top of the trench at the ruins of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_122' name='page_122'></a>122</span>
truck. It was blown apart, and the wooden body
and wheels were scattered about while the engine
was a mere mass of twisted and fused metal.</p>
<p>&#8220;Look! They didn&#8217;t get the driver!&#8221; cried
Bob, for as he spoke the man in charge of the
truck picked himself up from a clump of bushes
where he had been tossed, and limped toward the
American line. He had escaped death by a
miracle.</p>
<p>Then something else attracted the attention of
Bob, Jerry, and the others. It was the sight of
Ned Slade creeping along toward a pile of splintered
wood&mdash;all that was left of the demolished
truck.</p>
<p>&#8220;Who&#8217;s that? What is he doing?&#8221; cried the
officer in charge of that part of the trench. &#8220;Does
he hope to rescue the driver? Can&#8217;t he see that
the man is safe and is coming in? Who is he?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Private Slade, Sir,&#8221; replied Jerry.</p>
<p>&#8220;But what is he doing? That&#8217;s a foolhardy
piece of business, trying to reach that truck. It&#8217;s
under the fire of the German trench, as well as
within range of their battery. What is he trying
to do?&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV</h2>
<h3>THE SNIPER</h3>
</div>
<p>All stood looking from the trench at the actions
of Ned Slade.</p>
<p>&#8220;Look!&#8221; cried Bob, pointing to his chum.
&#8220;He&#8217;s picking up pieces of wood!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Has he gone crazy?&#8221; murmured the officer,
peering through his glasses at Private Slade.
&#8220;Does he think he can salvage anything from the
wreck?&#8221;</p>
<p>Just what Ned was thinking of was not evident.
He moved here and there amid the ruins of the
ammunition automobile, picking up bits of wood
until his arms could hold no more. It was raining
heavily, and when Ned stepped into a puddle
the mud and water could be seen to splash.</p>
<p>And then, when Ned could carry no more and
turned to come back to his own trench, the Germans,
in theirs, suddenly awoke to the chance they
had been missing. There were sharp reports, and
something besides rain drops splashed into the
pools of water all about Ned.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_124' name='page_124'></a>124</span></p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re firing at him! He&#8217;ll be killed!&#8221; cried
Bob.</p>
<p>&#8220;It seems very likely!&#8221; said the officer grimly.
&#8220;Who gave him permission to go out like that,
and why did he do it?&#8221;</p>
<p>No one answered. No one knew what to say.</p>
<p>And now Ned, aware of his own danger, began
to run toward the trench. He came on, stooping
over to offer less of a target to the Germans, and
he zig-zagged as he leaped forward. But through
it all, through the hail of lead, he did not drop the
pieces of the demolished truck he had picked up.</p>
<p>The firing from the German lines became hotter,
and a machine gun began to splutter.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s all up with him now!&#8221; said the officer, with
something like a groan. &#8220;I&#8217;ll order our guns to
shell the Hun trench, but it will be too late!&#8221;</p>
<p>He jumped down off the firing step, where he
and the others, including Jerry and Bob, were
standing, and started for the nearest telephone
that connected with a battery.</p>
<p>Just then Ned was seen to stagger.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s hit!&#8221; some one cried.</p>
<p>But if he was the lad who had taken such a desperate
chance did not stop. He dropped a piece
of wood, but still he ran on, stooping over, and
darting from side to side.</p>
<p>And at last he reached the trench where Bob,
Jerry, and his other comrades awaited him. The
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_125' name='page_125'></a>125</span>
rain had made the top of the trench slippery, and
Ned, striking this while going at full speed, fairly
slid down into the ditch, the wood dropping from
his arms all about.</p>
<p>&#8220;There you are!&#8221; he cried, as he recovered
himself. &#8220;Enough wood for two fires! Now we
can have something hot for breakfast! Bob, start
the coffee boiling! I&#8217;m like you&mdash;hungry!&#8221;</p>
<p>For a moment the others stood staring at him,
and then the officer came back.</p>
<p>&#8220;Did they get him?&#8221; he cried. &#8220;If they did
they&#8217;ll pay for it. We&#8217;ll wipe out the Hun trench
in another minute!&#8221;</p>
<p>Then he saw Ned, standing, surrounded by the
splintered, wooden parts of the ammunition truck.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, you&#8217;re here,&#8221; said the officer, mechanically,
as Ned saluted. &#8220;Well, what in the name of
General Pershing did you want to do that for?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I wanted some wood to make a fire for breakfast,
Sir,&#8221; answered Ned simply. &#8220;Some one took
our supply last night, and when I saw the truck
blown to pieces and noticed that the driver was
safe, I thought it a good chance to get some fairly
dry fuel. So I took it. Better pick it up though,
or it won&#8217;t be dry long,&#8221; he added to Jerry, and
the latter, with Bob&#8217;s help, obeyed. Ned had done
his share.</p>
<p>The officer stared at Ned as though the young
soldier were a new sort of fighter, and then, with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_126' name='page_126'></a>126</span>
a shake of his head, turned away. It was past
belief or understanding.</p>
<p>As the three chums moved back to where they
had set up an improvised stove, where they could
build a fire with the truck pieces Ned had brought
in, the ground shook with the thunder of the
American guns that soon enforced silence in the
German trenches. It was revenge for having fired
on Ned.</p>
<p>Technically Ned had been guilty of a breach of
the regulations, but though his venture into the
open had resulted in a whole battery being sent
into action, nothing further was said, officially, of
his conduct. Perhaps his bravery was admired by
the officer who saw it.</p>
<p>At any rate Ned, Bob and Jerry had a warm
breakfast, which they shared with some of their
chums, and then the day&#8217;s duty began. It was
performed in the rain, that seemed never-ceasing.
The bottom of the trench was a ditch of mud, in
spite of the duck boards laid down.</p>
<p>&#8220;Too bad Professor Snodgrass isn&#8217;t here,&#8221; remarked
Ned, as he pulled one foot up from the
mud and looked at it with the remark that he
wanted to make sure he still had the foot attached
to his person.</p>
<p>&#8220;Too bad the professor isn&#8217;t here! Why?&#8221;
asked Bob.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, he might find some new kind of bug in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_127' name='page_127'></a>127</span>
this&mdash;soup!&#8221; and Ned stirred the thick mud in
the bottom of the trench with the butt of his gun.
&#8220;It might be more interesting than seeing how
noises affect French crickets.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Crickets!&#8221; cried Jerry. &#8220;I feel sorry for any
self-respecting cricket that would stay here to be
affected. But, speaking of the professor, I wish
we could see him again. It would be like hearing
from home, and the letters are few and far between.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right,&#8221; admitted Ned. They had had
some missives from their people, and also the
girls, Alice, Helen and Mollie, while Bob, in addition,
had had a note from Helena Schaeffer, who
said she was knitting for the Red Cross. But, of
late, no mail had come in.</p>
<p>&#8220;I shouldn&#8217;t be surprised to see the professor
walk in on us any day,&#8221; mused Jerry. &#8220;He&#8217;s
likely to do it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then he&#8217;d better get a hustle on, or he may
not find us here,&#8221; observed Ned.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why not?&#8221; Bob inquired.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, there&#8217;s a rumor that we&#8217;re soon going
to attack again,&#8221; answered Ned. &#8220;And when we
go over the top we don&#8217;t come back to the old
trenches. We make new ones. So the professor,
if he doesn&#8217;t come soon, may find we have changed
our address.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Going to make an attack!&#8221; Jerry spoke softly.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_128' name='page_128'></a>128</span>
&#8220;Well, that&#8217;s the way to win the war. I hope it
will stop raining, though. I hate to fight in the
rain.&#8221;</p>
<p>But still the dreary drizzle kept up, and through
it the soldiers plodded in the mud of the trench.
It was nearly time for the three chums to be relieved
when Ned, who had a post at the right of
Jerry, suddenly gave a start, following a distant
report.</p>
<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221; asked his tall chum.</p>
<p>In answer Ned pointed to a spattery hole in
the trench wall behind him.</p>
<p>&#8220;The German sniper again,&#8221; he said. &#8220;And
I&#8217;m going to see if I can&#8217;t spot him. We&#8217;ve got
to get him!&#8221;</p>
<p>Ned took off his tin helmet and put it on his
bayonet. Then he slowly raised it above the top
of the trench, at the spot where the bullet had
come in. A moment later there was a vicious
&#8220;ping!&#8221; and the helmet bore a deep indentation.</p>
<p>&#8220;Spotted!&#8221; cried Ned. &#8220;I see where he keeps
himself! And now, fellows, if you&#8217;ll help, we&#8217;ll
get Mr. Fritz Sharpshooter, and get him good!
I&#8217;ve got his address now!&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI</h2>
<h3>OVER THE TOP</h3>
</div>
<p>&#8220;We haven&#8217;t much time,&#8221; remarked Jerry, as
he glanced at the watch on his wrist. &#8220;We&#8217;ll be
relieved in five minutes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s long enough,&#8221; returned Ned, with a
grim laugh. &#8220;If this fellow who has tried to get
me&mdash;or one of you&mdash;so often, runs true to form,
he&#8217;s done his last shooting. I know where he
keeps himself.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Where?&#8221; asked Bob.</p>
<p>Ned took his chums by the arms, and led them
a little way down the trench where there was an
improvised periscope. It was not being used by
the officer in charge just then, and Ned peered
through it.</p>
<p>He said nothing for a moment, and then called
to Jerry:</p>
<p>&#8220;Take a look at that brush pile just inside the
first line of German wire.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I see it,&#8221; remarked Jerry, after a look
through the mirror arrangement.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, that&#8217;s where Mr. Fritz is keeping himself,&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_130' name='page_130'></a>130</span>
said his chum. &#8220;It&#8217;s just in line with the
direction from which that last bullet came. I&#8217;ve
been thinking for some time that he was hidden
there, but I wasn&#8217;t sure until I saw the flash of his
gun as he nearly hit me just now. But now I&#8217;ll
get him!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That bush doesn&#8217;t seem big enough to shelter
a man,&#8221; observed Bob, as he, too, took an observation.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a hole dug under it, and he&#8217;s hiding in
that,&#8221; said Ned. &#8220;At first I thought the sharpshooter
was popping at us from some height, and
I believe he was, a week or so back. But now he
has changed his tactics. He&#8217;s doing ground sniping,
and that bit of bush hasn&#8217;t any roots.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you mean?&#8221; asked Jerry.</p>
<p>&#8220;I mean it&#8217;s a bit of camouflage. The sharpshooter
moves it about with him, thinking we&#8217;ll
believe it&#8217;s natural. He scoops a hole, gets in
with only his head sticking out, and puts this bit
of foliage in front of him as a screen. Now, Bob,
you take your helmet, and when I tell you hold it
up on your gun. Jerry, you come with me down
the trench a way, and please don&#8217;t fire until after
I do. If I miss, you get him, but I want first
shot.</p>
<p>&#8220;I want Bob to draw his fire, if he can,&#8221; explained
Ned. &#8220;I&#8217;ll be in reserve to shoot as soon
as I see the flash. If I miss you take him. It&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_131' name='page_131'></a>131</span>
got to be nip and tuck, and we&#8217;ll have to make it a
snap shot, for he&#8217;ll drop back into the hole after
he fires.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Go to it!&#8221; advised the tall lad. &#8220;I&#8217;m with
you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Quickly they made their preparations. While
Ned and Jerry went a little way down the trench,
Bob took off his helmet and put it on the end of
his gun. He then awaited the signal from
Ned.</p>
<p>&#8220;Show your tin hat!&#8221;</p>
<p>Slowly, and simulating as much as possible a
soldier raising his head above the top line of the
trench, Bob elevated the helmet. Hardly had he
done so when there came a sharp crack, and the
helmet spun around on the point of the bayonet as
a juggler spins a plate on the end of his walking
stick.</p>
<p>&#8220;Right O!&#8221; cried Ned, and, almost in the same
detonation as the firing of the German&#8217;s gun,
Ned&#8217;s rifle spoke. The clump of bushes seemed
to spout up into the air, blown by some underground
explosion, and then a figure was seen to
half leap from what must have been an excavation.</p>
<p>&#8220;You got him!&#8221; cried Jerry.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; assented Ned, as he lowered his gun.
&#8220;You won&#8217;t have to shoot, old man. Fritz won&#8217;t
do any more pot-hunting.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_132' name='page_132'></a>132</span></p>
<p>So that was the end of one German sharpshooter.</p>
<p>The three chums were congratulated by their
relief, which came soon after that, on ridding that
part of this particular sector of a menace that
had long been in evidence. More than one American
had been killed or wounded either by this
sharpshooter or by one who had adopted the same
tactics, and Ned, Bob and Jerry had well earned
the thanks of their comrades.</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you heard anything more about going
over the top soon?&#8221; asked Jerry.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing definite,&#8221; replied Ned, who had
started the rumor. &#8220;But don&#8217;t you feel a sort of
tenseness all around&mdash;as though something were
going to happen?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I do,&#8221; answered Bob. &#8220;I think it&#8217;s going to
happen that I&#8217;m going to have some chow. I
smell it coming!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re a heathen materialist!&#8221; declared Ned.</p>
<p>Bob proved a true prophet, for a few minutes
later a relief squad came to the dugout with a
traveling kitchen, or rather, some of the products
of one in the shape of hot beef stew and coffee.</p>
<p>Following the ending of the career of the German
sniper, the three Motor Boys, after several
strenuous days in the trenches, went back again to
a rest billet. There they recuperated, and really
enjoyed themselves. There were letters from
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_133' name='page_133'></a>133</span>
home to cheer them, and also a communication
from Professor Snodgrass.</p>
<p>The little scientist said he had tried in vain to
get some trace of the two missing girls, and expressed
the hope of seeing the boys soon, to get
the benefit of any advice they could give him. He
also stated that he was progressing well with his
scientific work of noting the effect of terrific noises
on insects. But, somehow or other, the Motor
Boys did not take as much interest in the pursuit
of the scientist as they had formerly.</p>
<p>&#8220;The war has changed everything,&#8221; declared
Jerry.</p>
<p>&#8220;But, of course, we&#8217;ll help him find the girls
if we can,&#8221; suggested Ned.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, of course,&#8221; agreed his tall chum.</p>
<p>Their stay in the rest camp was made pleasant
by the ministrations of the Y. M. C. A. and the
Knights of Columbus representatives. The chums
and their comrades spent much time in the different
huts, where they were entertained and could
get hot chocolate, candy or chewing gum&mdash;rations
not then issued by the army commissary.</p>
<p>&#8220;If it wasn&#8217;t for these organizations war would
be a whole lot worse than it is,&#8221; declared Jerry,
as they came from a Y. M. C. A. meeting and
moving-picture show one evening.</p>
<p>&#8220;And don&#8217;t forget the Salvation Army!&#8221; chimed
in Bob. &#8220;The fried holes those lassies turn out
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_134' name='page_134'></a>134</span>
are the best I ever ate&mdash;not excepting those
mother used to make.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, those doughnuts fill a big void, even if
they have a hole in the middle,&#8221; agreed Ned.</p>
<p>But all good things&mdash;even Salvation Army
doughnuts&mdash;come to an end some time, and so did
the rest period of the three friends. Back to the
trenches they went, to find out that what Ned had
predicted was about to happen. An attack of considerable
magnitude was in preparation, and it
was to be as much of a surprise to the Germans
as possible.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s going to be over the top all right,&#8221; declared
Jerry, when, one evening, they received
their final instructions. The attack, preceded by
a brief artillery preparation, was to take place at
dawn, the &#8220;zero hour&#8221; selected.</p>
<p>It was believed, and was proved true as after
events showed, that by considerably shortening the
artillery fire, the Germans would be unprepared.
They were used to the big guns bombarding them
for a day or more at a stretch before the infantry
came over. This was to be a change.</p>
<p>The night before the attack was a nervous one.
Yet those not on duty managed to get some sleep.
For many it would be their last.</p>
<p>Then came the general awakening, and the
moving of the men along the trenches to the posts
assigned to them. Each squad of men was in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_135' name='page_135'></a>135</span>
charge of an officer, commissioned or noncommissioned,
and in Jerry&#8217;s squad were Ned and Bob.</p>
<p>&#8220;Go over the top with a rush when you get the
signal, which will be three whistles after the barrage
has ceased,&#8221; were the instructions, and Ned,
Bob, and Jerry, with their comrades, prepared to
do this.</p>
<p>There was a period of tense waiting and then,
with a suddenness that shook their nerves and
bodies, as well as the whole earth about them, the
big guns opened fire.</p>
<p>That the Germans were taken by surprise was
evident by the failure to answer. For perhaps
five minutes it seemed as though a thousand of the
most terrific of thunder storms had been condensed
into one.</p>
<p>Then, as suddenly as it had begun, the firing
ceased. The &#8220;zero hour&#8221; had arrived.</p>
<p>Three shrill whistles, repeated from many
points, sounded on the now silent but quivering air.
Not a German gun had yet awakened.</p>
<p>&#8220;Over the top!&#8221; came the cry, and the friends,
with thousands of other brave lads, scrambled up
the ladders from the trenches and started toward
the German lines.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII</h2>
<h3>&#8220;FRIED HOLES&#8221;</h3>
</div>
<p>Ned, Bob, and Jerry were stationed in a sector
which was alternately defending the lines against
the Germans and attacking them in that part of
the country where the trend of the war eventually
led up to the terrific battles of St. Mihiel and the
Argonne Forest. But, up to this time, no one had
guessed that the whole nature of the war would be
so quickly changed with the advent of the Americans,
nor was it suspected what terrible fighting
would have to be undertaken by our boys; though,
of course, they were ready for the worst.</p>
<p>So that the battle in which the Motor Boys and
their comrades were now about to engage was
merely what was termed a local engagement.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, it meant everything&mdash;life and
death&mdash;to those engaged in it, though there was
never a thought of death in the hearts of any of
the brave men who went over the top as the big
guns ceased thundering and the shrill whistles gave
the signal.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come on, boys!&#8221; yelled Jerry, as he led Bob
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_137' name='page_137'></a>137</span>
and Ned forward, followed by the others in the
particular squad of which Jerry had charge.
&#8220;Come on!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yi! Yi! Yip!&#8221; screamed a young giant from
the South, as he leaped ahead of some of his
chums to the side of Jerry. &#8220;Show the Fritzies
how we fight!&#8221;</p>
<p>And together he and Jerry rushed on, followed
by Ned and Bob&mdash;a quartette acting as one man.</p>
<p>It was the first really big battle in which the
Cresville chums had taken part. They had been
out on skirmish work and on night patrol, and
they had come in conflict with parties of Germans,
but no large bodies. They had even each been
wounded slightly, but never before, in all their
lives, had they had a part in such a hailstorm of
death, such a turmoil of blood, mud, smoke, gas
and flying bullets as now. On and over the rough
shell-pitted ground they rushed toward the German
trenches. On they rushed in the gray dawn
of the morning, firing as they ran, hardly stopping
to take aim, for they could see the gray, indefinite
mass before them, and knew they were the
German troops who had rushed out of their
trenches to meet the onslaught.</p>
<p>At first the attack had been a surprise&mdash;a surprise
so great that the Germans could not, at the
beginning, reply even with adequate rifle fire, to
say nothing of artillery and machine guns.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_138' name='page_138'></a>138</span></p>
<p>But, in a moment, seemingly, all this was
changed. Tongues and slivers of fire began to
spit out from the gray ranks opposing the Americans.
There was a snarl of the lighter artillery
guns, the spiteful bark of the rifles and the wicked
rat-a-tat-tat of the machine guns, which the Germans
depended on, more than on anything else,
to stop a rush of our infantry.</p>
<p>Half way across No Man&#8217;s Land rushed Ned,
Bob, and Jerry, with their cheering, madly yelling
comrades, and then the toll of death began. It
was the fortune of war. Those that lived by rifles
and bayonets must perish by them, and for the
deaths that they exacted of the Huns their lives
were exacted in return.</p>
<p>Jerry, who with grim-set face and blazing eyes
rushed on at the side of the tall Southern giant,
heard a dull thud. Then came a sort of gasping,
choking cry that was audible even above the horrid
din of battle. Jerry, in a glance, saw his big
comrade crumple up in a heap, the whole front of
his body torn away by a piece of shell. And for
one terrible instant Jerry felt that he, himself,
must fall there, too, so terrible was the sight. But
he nerved himself to go on, and a backward glance
showed that Bob had to leap over the dead body
of the lad who but a moment before was yelling
encouragement to others.</p>
<p>But it was war, and it had to be.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_139' name='page_139'></a>139</span></p>
<p>On and on they rushed. Now they were at the
first line of the German barbed wire. Some of it
had been cut by the swift firing of shrapnel before
the troops came from their trenches. But enough
remained to be a hindrance, and quickly the men
with cutters surged forward to open the way.</p>
<p>It was while the Americans were held up here
that the Germans took fearful and heavy toll of
them with their machine guns, which were now
sputtering with terrific firing. Scores of brave
men went down, some never to rise again. Others,
only slightly wounded, staggered for a minute,
paused behind some dead comrade&#8217;s body to
adjust a bandage, and then went on.</p>
<p>Forward they rushed. Through the barbed
wire now, trampling down the cruel strands, never
heeding the bleeding wounds it tore in them, never
heeding the storm of bullets, minding not the
burst of shrapnel or high explosive.</p>
<p>On and on they went, yelling and shouting;
maddened with righteous anger against a ruthless
foe. Forward once more. Somehow, though
how they did it they never knew, Ned, Bob, and
Jerry stuck close to one another. Since the death
of the Southerner the three chums were in line
together, and stormed on. Their rifles were hot
in their hands, but still they fired.</p>
<p>&#8220;The first-line trenches!&#8221; yelled Ned, as he
pointed through the smoke.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_140' name='page_140'></a>140</span></p>
<p>And there, indeed, they were. They had passed
over No Man&#8217;s Land through a storm of death
which held many back. They had mastered the
barrier of the wire, and now were at the first line
of the German defense. And so fierce and terrible
had been the rush of the Americans the Germans
had fallen back, so that, save for lifeless
gray bodies, the trenches were unoccupied.</p>
<p>&#8220;Forward! Forward! Don&#8217;t stop! Go on!&#8221;
yelled the officers.</p>
<p>A certain objective had been set, and the commanders
were fearful lest the troops, thinking
that to capture the first German trenches was
enough, would stop there.</p>
<p>But they need not have been apprehensive.
The boys of Uncle Sam were not of that sort.
They wanted to come in closer contact with the
Boches. And they did.</p>
<p>On over the first-line trenches they rushed, but
now the fighting became hotter, for they were in
the midst of machine-gun nests, placed there for
just such a contingency. Death was on every side
now&mdash;horrible death. A bullet clipped Jerry&#8217;s
ear, but he only laughed&mdash;half madly and unconsciously,
no doubt&mdash;and rushed on. A man was
killed in front of him, and, falling forward,
tripped the tall lad, so that, for one terrible instant
Bob and Ned thought their chum had been
killed. But Jerry sprang up again, and, seeing a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_141' name='page_141'></a>141</span>
knot of Germans just ahead of him, tossed a hand
grenade among them. As a wisp of fog shuts out
a view, so the smoke of the grenade hid the group
of Huns for a moment. And when a swirl of the
air lifted the smoke curtain, a gray heap on the
ground was all that remained. It was like some
vision of the night, constantly changing.</p>
<p>On and on they rushed, shouting and shooting,
yelling and being yelled at. They panted for
breath, their tongues clove to their dry mouths,
they suffered horribly for water, but there was
only blood about them.</p>
<p>Forward they surged. So great was the first
rush that they fairly were carried&mdash;it did not seem
that they took themselves&mdash;beyond the last of that
particular line of German trenches. Now they
were actually on the open ground beyond&mdash;the
space where the Huns had their reserves, and these
were now quickly thrown into the battle.</p>
<p>Clip after clip of cartridges had been used by
the boys, and they were drawing on their reserve
supply now. But the battle was not going with
the same rush. The Germans were holding even
as a desperate eleven holds when it is on its own
goal line and the opponents are madly striving to
shove it over and out of the way, that a touchdown
may be made.</p>
<p>Following the instructions they had received,
the Americans began to look for what shelter they
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_142' name='page_142'></a>142</span>
could find&mdash;a hole in the ground, a heap of dirt,
the body of some fallen man, a slain horse, a heap
of rubbish, a dismantled machine gun, anything
that, for a time, would fend off a bullet.</p>
<p>The first, or shock-wave, of troops had gotten
as far as it was advisable to go, and they must
wait a moment for reinforcements and for the
artillery to come up. So it was that they threw
themselves flat, to escape the storm of bullets that
drove into their very faces.</p>
<p>There was no question, now, of surprising the
enemy. He was fully awake to his danger, and
had rushed all his available troops into the conflict.
He had an unusually large number of machine
guns, and on these he depended more than
on artillery or rifle fire to break up the attack.
And nothing more effectual could have been
chosen. Only, the Americans were determined
not to be stopped.</p>
<p>Hastily they began entrenching, digging shallow
ditches in which to find shelter. It does not take
much of a mound of earth to provide a shield
against rifle or machine-gun bullets, and in ten
minutes an advancing body of troops can provide
themselves with temporary protection, while in
half an hour they can almost be in trenches,
though these are not as deep as the permanent
ones.</p>
<p>While part of the advancing Americans still
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_143' name='page_143'></a>143</span>
maintained a fusillade from their rifles and from
a few machine guns that had been rushed up, others
used the intrenching tools. Then, when all
were under temporary shelter, they began assaulting
the Boches from their vantage places.</p>
<p>But now the Germans had begun to fight back
with their artillery, only, fortunately for Ned,
Bob, and Jerry, and their comrades, the range
was not yet ascertained, so that the shots flew well
over their heads. The shells landed back of the
American trenches which had been abandoned
when the order came to go over the top, and as
this ground was temporarily vacant no great harm
was done.</p>
<p>&#8220;There go our guns again!&#8221; cried Ned into
Jerry&#8217;s ear, as he lay stretched out beside his tall
chum.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. They&#8217;re trying to drive the Huns back
so we can go on. We&#8217;ve got to get farther than
this.&#8221;</p>
<p>The battle was now one of longer range, the
first fierceness of the infantry having spent itself.
Indeed, the men were practically out of ammunition,
though a reserve stock was being rushed to
them under the cover of the American guns.</p>
<p>A considerable space, corresponding to No
Man&#8217;s Land, separated the two lines, and over the
heads of the prostrate men flew the shells of their
respective batteries. So, for the time being, except
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_144' name='page_144'></a>144</span>
for stray shooting of rifles and machine guns,
the two confronting lines of infantry were comparatively
safe.</p>
<p>It was during this lull that Bob, looking back
from where he was sheltered by a little hill of
earth and stones, uttered a cry.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter?&#8221; asked Jerry quickly.
&#8220;Are you hit, Chunky?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hit? No! But look there! Fried holes!
See &#8217;em!&#8221;</p>
<p>For an instant both Ned and Jerry thought that
Bob had been seriously hurt, and was out of his
head. But they looked to where he pointed and saw
a man in the uniform of the Salvation Army coming
across the ground over which the Americans
had recently stormed. And the intrepid noncombatant
carried on either arm a big basket of a type
well known to our American fighters.</p>
<p>&#8220;Fried holes!&#8221; cried Bob. &#8220;Fried holes! Salvation
Army doughnuts, fellows! I&#8217;m going to
get some!&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>
<h3>THE SCHOOL JANITOR</h3>
</div>
<p>Just how it happened that the Salvation Army
worker had ventured into that place of death none
knew, and none stopped to inquire. Probably the
man, in his eagerness to serve, did not realize
where he was nor how he got there. Naturally
he would have been denied permission to go forward
during an engagement&mdash;that was no time
nor place for a noncombatant. But he probably
had not asked. He had made his way through a
rain of lead and steel to a zone of comparative
safety. And there he stood, as if bewildered, with
his baskets of cheer on his arms.</p>
<p>And now a sudden change in the battle made
the zone of comparative safety one of danger.
For the range of the German guns became
shorter. The muzzles were being depressed to
seek out those intrepid Americans who had rushed
over the first Hun trenches and were waiting to
rush onward again. This must not be, thought
the Huns, and so they sought them out to kill
them.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_146' name='page_146'></a>146</span></p>
<p>So it was that as Bob spied the &#8220;fried holes&#8221;
the dispenser of them gave a start as a bullet or a
piece of shell flew close to his head. He was in
grave danger now, and realized it. But he did
not falter. He gave one backward glance, not
with an idea of retreating, that is sure, but to see
if there were any near him in that direction whom
he might serve. Then he saw the prone lines
ahead of him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Me for some of those!&#8221; yelled Bob, as he rose
from his improvised trench.</p>
<p>&#8220;Lie still, you chump!&#8221; shouted Ned. &#8220;Do
you want to be killed?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No more than you did when you got the wood
from the busted truck,&#8221; was the answer. &#8220;But
I&#8217;ve got to have some of those doughnuts!&#8221;</p>
<p>And Bob, never heeding the fact that he would
be a shining target for the guns of the Germans,
started to run toward the Salvation Army man.</p>
<p>Some of the officers, from where they were stationed
among the troops, saw him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come back! Come back! Who is he?
What&#8217;s he doing? Is he going to desert in the face
of the enemy?&#8221; were some of the commands and
cries.</p>
<p>But it needed only a glance to show that Bob
never had a notion of deserting. He ran toward
the man with the baskets of doughnuts on his
arms. Crisp, golden-brown doughnuts they were,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_147' name='page_147'></a>147</span>
fresh from one of the traveling kitchens where,
behind the lines, the Salvation Army lassies made
them&mdash;a devoted service that will never be forgotten,
but will rank with that of the Red Cross
and be immortal.</p>
<p>And now, as might have been expected, the
Germans saw the two figures&mdash;the only upright
ones in that particular neighborhood. And the
inevitable followed. They were fired at.</p>
<p>Both offered good marks, but Fate, Providence,
or whatever you choose to call it, favored them,
or else the Germans were wretched shots, which
last, in a measure, is known to be true.</p>
<p>At any rate, Bob and the Salvation Army man
met and Bob took charge of one of the baskets
of doughnuts. That, too, was to be expected.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come on&mdash;run for it!&#8221; yelled the stout lad.
&#8220;This place is getting hot!&#8221;</p>
<p>And indeed it was, for all about their feet were
little spurts of earth, showing where the bullets
were striking. And together they ran on toward
the war-worn, weary figures of the men in the shallow
trenches. Straight to where he had left his
comrades Bob led the brave man, and they were
received with a cheer.</p>
<p>Though it was desperately against all orders
and discipline for Bob to do what he had done, not
an officer rebuked him. And then the &#8220;fried
holes&#8221; were quickly handed out to the fortunate
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_148' name='page_148'></a>148</span>
ones in that section of the line, the officers refusing
any, so that the weary men might have some
little refreshment.</p>
<p>&#8220;Halves only&mdash;each man only take a half!&#8221;
cried Ned, when he saw how many men there were
and how few&mdash;in spite of the two big baskets&mdash;the
doughnuts were.</p>
<p>Bob looked a trifle crestfallen, but he agreed
with a smile, and to his eternal credit be it said
that when he broke the one doughnut he saved for
himself, and it came apart in two unequal pieces,
he gave the larger section to a comrade on his
right.</p>
<p>&#8220;Bravo, Chunky!&#8221; said Jerry softly, as he observed.</p>
<p>And then, as if in horrible contrast to this
peaceful scene, the battle began again.</p>
<p>&#8220;Forward!&#8221; came the orders, and the three
chums, with their comrades, sprang from their
shelter.</p>
<p>And as Bob left the shallow hole he had dug
for himself to see what became of the Salvation
Army man, he saw him roll gently over on his
side, a little hole in his forehead showing where
death had entered from one of the hundreds of
bullets that were now sweeping down among the
troops. But there was a smile on his lips.</p>
<p>And there died a very brave and gallant gentleman.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_149' name='page_149'></a>149</span></p>
<p>Burst and roar and rumble and thunder and
shriek and yell and cry and sob succeeded, accompanied
and overlapped one another. The battle
was on again in all its horrid fury.</p>
<p>Forward rushed the troops, freshened by their
rest, with more ammunition of death. Forward
they rushed, driving the Germans back, out of the
trenches improvised by the Huns. Forward they
rushed while the American guns lifted the barrage
to protect them, and the German cannon crashed
out their answer.</p>
<p>On they went, stumbling, falling, getting up
again some of them, never rising again many of
them. Bloody and mud-stained, powder-grimed
and sweat-marked, torn and panting, cut and
bruised, with dry tongues that swelled in their
blackened mouths. With eyes that saw nothing
and everything&mdash;the sight of comrades torn to
pieces beside them, the falling of beloved officers,
the tearing of great holes in the ranks, and the
closing of those holes by a living wall of others
who offered themselves for the sacrifice.</p>
<p>Forward they rushed, shouting and firing, tossing
hand grenades into the midst of the dust-gray
bodies of the Huns that opposed them. Onward
they leaped and ran and staggered and jumped,
but always onward.</p>
<p>A yell on their left caught the ears of Jerry and
his chums.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_150' name='page_150'></a>150</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Are we giving way?&#8221; asked Ned, grimly despairing.</p>
<p>&#8220;No! It&#8217;s the tanks! Look!&#8221; screamed Bob.</p>
<p>And the tanks it was. A score of them, great
lumbering giants, impervious to everything save
heavy guns, on they crawled, smashing concrete
machine-gun nests as though they were but collections
of vipers&#8217; eggs in a field.</p>
<p>These tanks turned the tide of battle at that
particular point. For the Germans were putting
up a stiff resistance, and were about to launch a
counter-attack, as was learned later.</p>
<p>But with the tanks to protect them, to splatter
death from their armored machine guns, to spread
terror and fear among the Huns, the day was
saved.</p>
<p>On rushed the Americans, Ned, Bob, and Jerry
among them, while all about them thundered the
big guns, rattled the rifles, adding their din to
the tat-a-tat-tat of the machine guns.</p>
<p>And then the Germans, unable to withstand this
withering fire and being inadequately supported
by their artillery, broke in confusion and ran&mdash;ran
to escape the terrible death that awaited them
from the avengers of a world dishonored by the
Boches.</p>
<p>Wave after wave of storming troops now
surged over the positions lately occupied in force
by the Germans. Up the wooded slopes they
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_151' name='page_151'></a>151</span>
swept, taking possession of dominant heights so
long desired. The objective was more than won,
and the American position much improved.</p>
<p>The fury of the fighting began to die away.
But it was still terrific in spots, for there were
many machine-gun nests left behind when the Huns
retreated, and the holders of them were told to
die at their posts. Many did.</p>
<p>When Ned, Bob, Jerry, and some of their comrades,
led by an officer, approached one of the
dugouts there was no sign of life. It had been
spouting death from a machine gun but a little
while before, however.</p>
<p>&#8220;Look out!&#8221; some one shouted. &#8220;Maybe
they&#8217;re playing possum!&#8221;</p>
<p>And so it was, for as the group advanced there
was a burst of fire, and half a dozen men went
down. Ned and Bob had a vision of Jerry crumpling
up at the very entrance of the dugout, and
their hearts seemed to stop beating.</p>
<p>&#8220;Drive &#8217;em out! Kill the Boches! Wipe &#8217;em
up!&#8221; yelled the survivors.</p>
<p>With a fierce yell, Ned tossed into the open
doorway a hand grenade. It exploded with terrific
force, partly wrecking the place, and then in
rushed he and his comrades, with gleaming bayonets.</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Kamerad! Kamerad!</i>&#8221; came the cowardly
appeal from the Germans.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_152' name='page_152'></a>152</span></p>
<p>And a moment later out of the dugout where
the machine gun had been concealed came four
German soldiers, all that was left alive of a company
of twenty, and of these four two were badly
wounded.</p>
<p>Ned and Bob, seeing that the place, the last
of any opposition in that section, was captured,
were about to turn back to see if Jerry was still
alive, when a second look at one of the German
prisoners caused Ned to cry:</p>
<p>&#8220;Nick Schmouder!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Ja!</i>&#8221; came the answer, and then, in German,
he asked:</p>
<p>&#8220;Who speaks my name?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nick Schmouder!&#8221; said Ned again.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you know this man?&#8221; asked an officer
sharply.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; answered Ned. &#8220;He used to be a janitor
at Boxwood Hall, a school I attended.&#8221;</p>
<p>And the face of Nick Schmouder showed as
much wonder as did that of Ned Slade.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIX</h2>
<h3>NEWS AT LAST</h3>
</div>
<p>&#8220;Well, well, Nick! To think of meeting you
here!&#8221; exclaimed Bob.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t speak to the Hun!&#8221; some one called,
and then, for the first time, Ned and Bob seemed
to realize that the little man, with whom they had
been on friendly terms at college, was an
enemy.</p>
<p>But such was the case. It was only one of
many queer incidents of the war, and more than
one fighting American found among the prisoners
sent back, after he and his comrades had cleaned
up a Boche nest, some man he had known back
home&mdash;a former waiter at a club, perhaps, or a
man who delivered his groceries.</p>
<p>&#8220;How came you here?&#8221; asked Nick Schmouder,
with scarcely a trace of German accent, as he and
the other prisoners stood with upraised hands,
though one of the survivors had to drop his as he
fell in a heap because of weakness from his
wounds.</p>
<p>&#8220;We came here to teach the Kaiser how to walk
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_154' name='page_154'></a>154</span>
Spanish,&#8221; said Bob. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t think you&#8217;d fight
against us, Nick, after what you learned at Boxwood
Hall.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ach! I was forced to,&#8221; was the answer. &#8220;I
am glad it is over&mdash;that I am a prisoner. I did
not like this war. I shall be glad when it is over
and you have won. It is terrible! Listen, I will
a secret tell,&#8221; and he did not seem afraid of the
effect it might have on his apathetic comrades.
&#8220;Every time I shoot the machine gun I point it at
the ground so it will kill no Americans. I do not
want to kill them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hum, that&#8217;s a good story to tell now!&#8221; said
the incredulous officer. &#8220;Take &#8217;em to the rear
with the other prisoners. Wait, though, this one
can&#8217;t walk. He&#8217;ll have to have a stretcher. I&#8217;ll
have his wounds patched up. But take the others
back. Corporal Hopkins!&#8221; he called.</p>
<p>&#8220;Corporal Hopkins is wounded, Sir,&#8221; reported
Ned, with a catch in his voice. &#8220;He may be dead.
He fell just as we stormed this place, Sir!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I did not know that. See to him at once.
Here!&#8221; he called to some stretcher-bearers who
were coming up, &#8220;we may need you!&#8221;</p>
<p>They hurried forward, and, leaving Nick
Schmouder and the other German prisoners under
guard, the officer, with Ned, Bob, and some other
Americans, went back to where Jerry had been
seen to fall. It was just outside of a little defile
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_155' name='page_155'></a>155</span>
leading to the dugout where the machine gun had
wrought such havoc.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&mdash;there he is!&#8221; faltered Ned, as he
pointed to the crumpled-up body of his chum, and
Bob turned his face away, for it seemed to be the
end of Jerry Hopkins.</p>
<p>There was blood on Jerry&#8217;s head, and blood
had seeped out from his right leg, near the knee.
Poor Jerry lay very still, and about him were
heaped others, who were unmistakably dead.</p>
<p>The lieutenant bent over the corporal and made
a hasty examination. There was relief on his
face&mdash;relief which was reflected on the countenances
of Ned and Bob as he said:</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s still alive, but badly hurt, I&#8217;m afraid.
Take him back as gently as you can.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ned and Bob helped lift him on to the stretcher.
Jerry did not move, and so faint was his breathing
that there were times when it seemed to stop
altogether.</p>
<p>Desperately as Ned and Bob wanted to go back
to the dressing station to learn how it fared with
their chum, they must stay on duty in the advanced
position they had helped to win. It must be consolidated
as much as possible before night, or the
Germans might launch a counter offensive.</p>
<p>And so, when the Hun machine gun had been
turned about, ready to rake any advancing lines
of its recent owners, other measures were taken
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_156' name='page_156'></a>156</span>
to insure the holding of the position won at such
cost.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d like to have a talk with that Nick,&#8221; said
Bob, as he and Ned paused for a moment in their
work of digging trenches.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, isn&#8217;t it strange to meet him here like this?
If he fired any of the shots that did up Jerry
Hopkins, why&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p>Ned did not finish, but Bob knew what his chum
meant.</p>
<p>Feverishly the Americans worked, and to good
purpose, for when darkness began to fall they
were in strong front trenches with supporting lines
back of them, and the artillery was partly in place.
If the Germans wanted to take that particular
hill again they would have to work for every inch
of it.</p>
<p>And now the commissary department got busy,
and hot soup and coffee was rushed up to the well-nigh
exhausted men. Never was a meal more
welcome.</p>
<p>&#8220;But it doesn&#8217;t taste any better than those
doughnuts did,&#8221; declared Bob, as he sat on a pile
of dirt, sipping coffee from a tin cup, his face and
hands plastered with mud and other dirt.</p>
<p>&#8220;You took an awful chance, though, Chunky,&#8221;
said his chum.</p>
<p>&#8220;No more than that Salvation Army man did.
He was braver than I, because it was my business
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_157' name='page_157'></a>157</span>
to be where I was, and he didn&#8217;t have to if he
didn&#8217;t want to.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, that&#8217;s so,&#8221; agreed Ned. &#8220;But say, I&#8217;m
going to see if we can&#8217;t find out how Jerry is.
If he&mdash;if he&#8217;s&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p>But he did not have the heart to finish.</p>
<p>As much had been done as was possible that
day, after the terrific battle, and with the arrival
of fresh reserves those who had borne the brunt
of the fighting were sent to the rear to rest. Ned
and Bob were among these, and, obtaining permission,
they went to the dressing station to learn
Jerry&#8217;s fate.</p>
<p>Their hearts leaped with joy when they were
told that, aside from a bad scalp wound and a
bullet through the fleshy part of his leg, their
chum was all right.</p>
<p>The high-powered bullets do infinitely less
damage than the old-fashioned slower-moving
sort, and the wound in Jerry&#8217;s leg was a clean
one.</p>
<p>Not so, however, the cut on his head, which
was from a piece of burning shell, making a jagged
wound that, however, did not touch the bone.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;ll be back in line again in three weeks,&#8221;
declared the surgeon to Ned and Bob, and those
were the happiest words they ever had heard.</p>
<p>The next morning, after a feverish night in
which they slept but little, they were allowed to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_158' name='page_158'></a>158</span>
see Jerry, and they found him in better condition,
relatively, than themselves. For he had been
given a bath and cleaned after his wounds were
dressed, whereas Ned and Bob were still caked
with the mud, dirt, and grime of battle. But it
was honorable dirt, as a Japanese might say.
Most honorable and cherished.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, how about you, old man?&#8221; asked Ned,
as the Red Cross nurse said they might talk a little
to their injured chum.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;m all right. Feel fine! Just knocked
out a little. Save a few Huns for me for the next
rush.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, we&#8217;ll do that all right,&#8221; agreed Bob.
&#8220;Too bad you had to get yours just as we won the
game.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We won it, so I hear,&#8221; observed Jerry.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, cleaned &#8217;em up,&#8221; went on Ned. &#8220;And
whom do you guess we caught in the last batch of
prisoners?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not Professor Snodgrass!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No. But some one who knows him. Nick
Schmouder!&#8221; exploded Bob.</p>
<p>&#8220;What? Not the janitor at Boxwood Hall?
The fellow who helped us get the goat upstairs
into the physics class?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The same!&#8221; laughed Ned; and Jerry chuckled
so at the recollection of one of the jokes of their
college days that the nurse was forced to say she
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_159' name='page_159'></a>159</span>
would order his chums away unless he remained
more quiet.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll be good!&#8221; promised the tall lad. &#8220;But
that is rich! How did it happen?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t know,&#8221; admitted Ned. &#8220;I&#8217;m going to
have a talk with him if I can.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Let me know what he says,&#8221; begged Jerry.
&#8220;I don&#8217;t suppose you have heard anything about
the professor or his quest for the two girls?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; answered Bob. &#8220;I guess he&#8217;ll never find
them. It&#8217;s worse than looking for a cent down a
crack in the boardwalk at Atlantic City. But I
don&#8217;t suppose you could convince the professor
of that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; agreed Jerry. &#8220;I&#8217;m mighty sorry, too.
You remember what he said about losing the
money he had lent to a friend of his and needing
this bequest from Professor Petersen. Well, if
you see or hear from him let me know. I won&#8217;t
be able to get about for a week&mdash;maybe more.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bob and Ned stayed until the nurse sent them
away, but they promised to call again as soon as
allowed. Then, as they were relieved from duty,
they went to an officer and received permission to
talk to the prisoner, Nick Schmouder, after explaining
about him.</p>
<p>The man had been a janitor at Boxwood Hall
when Ned, Bob, and Jerry attended there. He
had been a good friend to the three chums, and,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_160' name='page_160'></a>160</span>
as mentioned, had assisted them in performing
what they were pleased to term a &#8220;joke.&#8221;</p>
<p>The boys had forgotten all about him, and it
was with the utmost wonder they met him again
under such strange and strenuous circumstances.</p>
<p>&#8220;How did you come to get into the war?&#8221; asked
Bob, as he and Ned talked to the prisoner, who
was in a wire cage with hundreds of others.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, it was an accident, yet. I came back to
Germany to see my old father, and I was caught
here when the war broke out. I had not served
my full time in the army, and so I had to go in
again. Ach! how I hate it. But tell me&mdash;why
are you here?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The same reason that brought every other
good American over,&#8221; replied Ned sharply. &#8220;We
want to wipe Prussian militarism off the face of
the earth.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And a good job, I say!&#8221; declared Nick
Schmouder. &#8220;It is like a bad disease germ. One
of those bugs Professor Snodgrass used to show
me in the microscope. Ah, I wish I was back at
Boxwood Hall with him. He was a nice little
man.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, he was,&#8221; agreed Ned. &#8220;And you may see
him, if you stay around here.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;See him? Is the professor in the war, too?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not exactly,&#8221; Bob answered. &#8220;He is here on
a scientific mission. Something about war noises
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_161' name='page_161'></a>161</span>
and insects. But he is after something else, too.
A friend of his, Professor Petersen&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Professor Emil Petersen?&#8221; cried Nick
Schmouder in such a strange voice that Ned and
Bob stared at him. &#8220;Did you say Professor Emil
Petersen?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know that I mentioned his first name,
but it is Emil,&#8221; answered the stout lad. &#8220;Why,
do you know him?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Know him? Why, he once lived in the same
German town where my father and mother lived,&#8221;
declared the former janitor. &#8220;They were friends,&mdash;my
father worked for him and my mother had
looked after him when he was sick&mdash;and when
the professor, who was studying or something, had
to go away, he left his two nieces&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Two nieces!&#8221; burst out Ned and Bob together.
&#8220;Do you mean Miss Gladys Petersen
and Miss Dorothy Gibbs?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes! Those were the names,&#8221; announced
Schmouder easily. &#8220;He left the two nieces with
my father and mother. They were nice girls!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Listen to that!&#8221; cried Ned, thumping Bob on
the back. &#8220;News at last! We must tell Jerry
this!&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XX</h2>
<h3>A QUEER QUESTION</h3>
</div>
<p>So unexpected was the news given by the captured
Boxwood Hall janitor that for a moment
or two Ned and Bob could scarcely believe it.
That the information, so much desired and so
ardently sought after, should come to them by
accident, while, doubtless, Professor Snodgrass
was using every energy to that end, seemed
scarcely believable. Yet there could be no doubt
of it. Still Ned was a bit cautious, and restrained
his stout chum from rushing to the hospital to tell
Jerry.</p>
<p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t want any mistake in this,&#8221; remarked
Ned. &#8220;Are you sure, Nick, that this is the same
Professor Petersen whom we mean, the same one
Professor Snodgrass means?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see how there can be any mistake,&#8221; declared
the former janitor. &#8220;I often heard Professor
Petersen speak of Professor Snodgrass,
and I know him well enough. I could tell him in
the dark.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I guess that&#8217;s right,&#8221; assented Ned.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_163' name='page_163'></a>163</span></p>
<p>&#8220;But there may be two Professor Petersens&mdash;the
name is not uncommon in Germany, at any rate.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There is no mistake,&#8221; declared Schmouder.
&#8220;I admit there may be several Professor Petersens,
but hardly two who would have nieces named
Dorothy Gibbs and Gladys Petersen.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That seems to clinch it,&#8221; declared Bob.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I guess so,&#8221; agreed his chum. &#8220;But what
else can you tell us about them, Nick, and where
are the girls now?&#8221;</p>
<p>The German prisoner shrugged his shoulders.</p>
<p>&#8220;As for where they are now, I do not know,&#8221;
he answered. &#8220;My father and mother live in a
little town not far from Metz. It was there Professor
Petersen came sometimes to study and write
his books, when he was not in his own country or
in your country, lecturing or visiting Professor
Snodgrass.</p>
<p>&#8220;Just before this terrible war, which I wish with
all my heart I had never seen, Professor Petersen
came to this little town, bringing for the first time
his two nieces. I happened to be there on a visit&mdash;I
came to see my parents, and now I wish I
hadn&#8217;t.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I will not say that!&#8221; quickly exclaimed the
man. &#8220;I am glad I saw them; but I wish I had
sent for them to come to the United States to see
me. It would have been safer for them and me,
for we shall lose this war&mdash;I can see that.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_164' name='page_164'></a>164</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You said it!&#8221; declared Bob, with energy.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tell us all you can,&#8221; urged Ned. &#8220;We have
a great interest in finding these girls.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I am sorry I cannot tell you more,&#8221; replied
Schmouder. &#8220;As I said, I came back just
before the war broke out, was caught and sent
to the army. I saw Professor Petersen in my
home town then with the two young ladies. There
was some story about his having been reconciled
to them after a long estrangement, but I did not
pay much attention to that.</p>
<p>&#8220;All I know is that I saw the young ladies and
knew they were the nieces of the professor. They
had been traveling in France and Germany, it was
said. Then the professor left just before war
was declared. He suspected it was coming, and
said he had certain investigations he wished to
make before the fighting started. He left the two
young ladies in charge of my father and mother,
telling them he would be back as soon as he could,
and that, thereafter, he would look after them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What happened next?&#8221; asked Bob.</p>
<p>&#8220;The war,&#8221; answered Schmouder succinctly.
&#8220;That spoiled everything. I had to go away and
leave my parents. What has become of them I
do not know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Haven&#8217;t you heard from them?&#8221; asked Ned.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not lately, no. Soon after I was forced to
join the army I had a letter, in which they told
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_165' name='page_165'></a>165</span>
me they were going farther into Germany to be
safer.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And what about the two girls and Professor
Petersen?&#8221; Bob queried.</p>
<p>&#8220;What happened to Professor Petersen I cannot
tell you,&#8221; was the answer. &#8220;As for his two
nieces, my father wrote that they had gone on
some scientific expedition shortly after the professor
left them, and were not expected back for a
month.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Were they scientists too?&#8221; asked Ned.</p>
<p>&#8220;I believe so,&#8221; answered the former janitor.
&#8220;They loved study, as did their uncle. At any
rate they, too, went into the interior of Germany
just before the war broke out, and what has happened
to them I do not know any more than I
know what happened to Professor Petersen.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We can tell you what happened to him,&#8221; said
Ned. &#8220;He died in America, and left a lot of
money.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So!&#8221; exclaimed Schmouder. &#8220;Well, it will do
no one any good these terrible days.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe it will, and perhaps it won&#8217;t,&#8221; replied
Bob. &#8220;At any rate, he left half his fortune to
Professor Snodgrass on condition that our friend
find the two nieces and give them the other half
of the fortune.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ach! Well, I shall be glad if the young ladies
get something,&#8221; said Schmouder.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_166' name='page_166'></a>166</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, but the trouble is they won&#8217;t get it if they
can&#8217;t be found,&#8221; said Ned. &#8220;And Professor Snodgrass
won&#8217;t get anything, either. Now if you
could only tell us where these two girls are to be
found, why&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That I could not do&mdash;no one could in these
days!&#8221; declared the prisoner earnestly. &#8220;I will
help you all I can. I am an American at heart,
and I hope you will believe me when I say that
every gun I fired sent its bullets only into the
ground. I could not shoot at my former friends.
Germany is no longer a friend to me!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nor to any one else,&#8221; declared Bob. &#8220;Gee!
but it&#8217;s tough to be so near the solution and then
to fail.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t give up yet,&#8221; advised Ned. &#8220;We can
tell Professor Snodgrass what we have learned,
and maybe he can find a way to get in communication
with the young ladies. It&#8217;s a pity Professor
Petersen didn&#8217;t give them half his fortune when
he was alive, and save all this bother.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, it would have been a good idea!&#8221; scoffed
his chum. &#8220;The girls and Professor Snodgrass
would have been better off. But, as a rule, people
don&#8217;t do that sort of thing. I haven&#8217;t noticed
your father&mdash;nor mine&mdash;giving away half of his
possessions. However, the money may be lost
entirely now. I don&#8217;t see how it can be paid over,
inherited or whatever the term is anyhow, in these
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_167' name='page_167'></a>167</span>
days. Maybe the war has wiped out Professor
Petersen&#8217;s fortune.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I hardly think that,&#8221; said the former janitor.
&#8220;He was not a German, and his wealth was not
in that country. He was a very careful man, and
if he left any money to any one you may be sure
it is waiting for them, wherever they are.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the point!&#8221; exclaimed Bob. &#8220;The
money may be all right, but we can&#8217;t find those
for whom it is intended. And if Professor Snodgrass
can&#8217;t locate the girls, all the fortune goes to
a humane society.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ach! So?&#8221; exclaimed Nicholas Schmouder.
&#8220;Well, it is better that than Germany should get
it. Please tell your friends that I did never fire
my gun at them&mdash;always into the ground,&#8221; he
said wistfully, as the boys turned away from the
prisoners&#8217; wire cage.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll do the best we can for you,&#8221; they said.
But there was little they could do to make life any
easier for their old friend, who, through no fault
of his own, was in a bad predicament.</p>
<p>When next they had a chance to visit Jerry the
two chums told him all they had heard, and the
wounded lad suggested that they should write to
Professor Snodgrass at once, urging him to come
on and have a talk with Schmouder. This Ned
and Bob did, though there was no certainty that
their letter would reach the scientist, or that he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_168' name='page_168'></a>168</span>
would be able to obey the instructions in it. They
had his last address, but he was, at best, uncertain
in his movements, and now, with the great forward
movement of the American armies beginning,
it was hard for any one to get to the front.</p>
<p>&#8220;But we&#8217;ve found out something, anyhow,&#8221; declared
Ned. &#8220;The girls are somewhere in Germany,
if they are still alive, and it may be possible
for Professor Snodgrass to give them half the
money and keep the other half for his own necessities.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, it may, and it may not. I hope it will,
though.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jerry, thanks to the nature of his wounds and
to his healthy constitution, made a remarkably
quick recovery, and though he was not ready to
go back to the front-line trenches when his chums
had to report for duty, it was probable that after
their next rest period he would join them.</p>
<p>It was hard for Ned and Bob to say good-bye
to their chum. They might never meet again, and
they knew it. But it was the fortune of war, and
had to be borne.</p>
<p>Fate, however, was kind to them, and Ned and
Bob were sent to a quiet sector. After some slight
skirmishes, which, however, were hard enough
on those engaged, they were again sent to the
rear to recuperate. There they found Jerry chafing
against being kept out of the fighting.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_169' name='page_169'></a>169</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Feel all right?&#8221; asked Ned.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure! Never better. I want to get at the
Huns again.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Didn&#8217;t hear from Professor Snodgrass, did
you?&#8221; inquired Bob.</p>
<p>&#8220;No. But I wrote to him again. Schmouder
has been sent back to the rear to work with other
prisoners, but I have his camp location so the professor
can interview him if he thinks it needful.
And say, a rather queer thing happened while you
were away.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What?&#8221; asked Ned.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, Noddy Nixon came to see me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He did!&#8221; cried Bob. &#8220;Well, the nerve of that
shrimp! After he took our wood!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What did he want?&#8221; asked Ned.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, nothing in particular, as far as I could
make out. Just seemed to want to be friendly.
Asked me a lot of questions about how I was
treated in the hospital and whether I got enough
to eat.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You did, didn&#8217;t you?&#8221; asked Bob.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure. But I don&#8217;t quite see what Noddy was
aiming at. However, I didn&#8217;t trouble my head
much about it until yesterday.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why yesterday?&#8221; Bob demanded.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, the surgeon who patched me up came
and inquired if Noddy was a particular friend of
mine.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_170' name='page_170'></a>170</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Of course you told him he was!&#8221; laughed Ned.</p>
<p>&#8220;Like fun I did! No, I said I hadn&#8217;t any use
for him, but I didn&#8217;t go into particulars. After
all, Noddy is fighting on our side.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You mean he&#8217;s making a bluff at it!&#8221; growled
Bob. &#8220;But go on. Where does the queer part
come in?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Here,&#8221; answered Jerry. &#8220;The surgeon told
me Noddy took him to one side and asked very
particularly whether a wound in the hand or one
in the foot hurt the most. That&#8217;s what he wanted
to know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He did!&#8221; cried Ned. &#8220;Well, what&#8217;s queer
about that?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you see,&#8221; resumed Jerry, &#8220;it looks as
though&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p>But Jerry never finished that sentence, for as
he was speaking came cries of alarm from outside
the hospital and the firing of several guns,
while some one shouted:</p>
<p>&#8220;An air raid! An air raid! The Huns are
coming!&#8221;</p>
<hr class='major' />

<h2>CHAPTER XXI</h2>
<h3>A VISITOR</h3>
</div>
<p>Jerry Hopkins, with his two chums and some
of the hospital patients who were able to move
about, rushed toward the sound of the shouting
and firing. Jerry&#8217;s leg wound was healed, and
save for a slight limp he was all right again.</p>
<p>The boys saw a group of soldiers gathered
about a battery of guns erected a short time before
to repel air raids. And that this was now a
time to use the weapons was evident after a glance
aloft.</p>
<p>For, hovering just below the clouds, were three
big Hun planes, and that they had come over the
lines to bomb the American positions was only
too evident.</p>
<p>There was no time to stop and inquire how the
hostile aircraft had managed to elude the vigilance
of the Allied airmen at the front. It was time to
act and act promptly, and at once the anti-aircraft
batteries opened, while word was quickly telephoned
to the nearest aerodrome, so that American,
French, or British fliers might ascend to attack
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_172' name='page_172'></a>172</span>
the Germans. It was the shooting at the
Hun planes with the guns nearest the hospital that
had broken in on Jerry&#8217;s remarks.</p>
<p>&#8220;They won&#8217;t bomb the hospital, will they?&#8221;
asked Ned, in wonder.</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re very likely to,&#8221; declared Jerry.
&#8220;Then later on they&#8217;ll claim they couldn&#8217;t see the
red crosses on the roof, or else they&#8217;ll say they
meant to drop bombs on an ammunition dump or
a railroad center and they miscalculated the distance&mdash;the
beasts!&#8221;</p>
<p>If the Huns intended to bomb the hospital now
it would not be the first time they had done such
a dastardly trick. And that they purposed sending
down explosives somewhere in the neighborhood
was evident from the tactics of the hostile
machines.</p>
<p>They flew about, so high above the group of
buildings containing the wounded and convalescents
as to make it difficult to hit them, and appeared
to be waiting their best chance to drop a
bomb where it would do the most damage.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, nurses and orderlies were moving
out their charges into the open, so there would be
less likelihood of their being caught in the collapsed
structures.</p>
<p>For a few minutes the scene was one of wild
confusion, and then army discipline was established
and matters went on as they should. Ned,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_173' name='page_173'></a>173</span>
Bob, and Jerry helped in taking out the wounded,
while the gun crews increased their fire at the
hostile planes.</p>
<p>Suddenly there was a terrific explosion just in
the rear of the hospital. It shook the ground and
brought forth screams of agonized apprehension
on the part of men suffering from shell shock.
But either the bomb was misdirected or the Huns
were more merciful than they had been on other
similar occasions, for the bomb, dropped from one
of the aircraft, only tore a big hole in an adjacent
field.</p>
<p>&#8220;Too close for comfort, though,&#8221; declared
Ned.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our boys are gettin&#8217; after &#8217;em!&#8221; exclaimed
Bob, as he and his chums hurried back into the
endangered building to assist in taking out more
of the helpless ones.</p>
<p>This was true in two senses, for the fire of the
anti-aircraft batteries was increasing, and now
several Allied airmen were mounting aloft in their
swift machines to give battle to the attacking
Huns.</p>
<p>It was high time, too, for now bombs were
dropping on all sides of the hospital, and there
was no telling when the entire building might go
down in ruins. Whether the German airmen were
deliberately trying to hit the place where wounded
men were being saved from death, or whether they
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_174' name='page_174'></a>174</span>
aimed their infernal machines at objects near it,
could not be said with certainty.</p>
<p>Fiercer and more rapid became the firing from
the anti-aircraft batteries established near the hospital
for this very purpose, and more Allied planes
took the air, seeking to drive off the invaders.</p>
<p>By this time most of the wounded had been carried
out and put under trees, in the open, wherever
it was considered safest for them.</p>
<p>Though from the ruthless manner in which the
Huns waged war no place was immune from their
bombs&mdash;even in the neighborhood of a hospital.</p>
<p>&#8220;Look! Look!&#8221; suddenly cried Ned. &#8220;They
got one!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right!&#8221; echoed Jerry. &#8220;They&#8217;ve
brought one down!&#8221;</p>
<p>Tumbling over and over, in a fashion no airman,
however reckless, would dare to imitate as
a ruse, was one of the German planes. It had
been hit either by a shell from a battery, or the
bullets from one of the machine guns on an Allied
plane had found a mark.</p>
<p>Then, as the invading machine continued to fall,
out of control, it burst into flames, and a small
dark object was seen to detach itself from the
mass and fall to one side.</p>
<p>&#8220;There goes the pilot!&#8221; said Bob grimly.
&#8220;He&#8217;s done for.&#8221;</p>
<p>And so he was, and so was his machine. It was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_175' name='page_175'></a>175</span>
a horrible death, but none the less horrible than
he had planned for others&mdash;and helpless others,
too.</p>
<p>&#8220;There they go! They&#8217;ve had enough!&#8221;
shouted Ned, and as he spoke it was seen that the
Hun machines, which had been circling about, as
though looking for more targets on the ground
below, had turned and were speeding toward their
own lines, pursued by the American and other
machines, eager to visit on them just vengeance.</p>
<p>And then the hospital patients, some of them
wounded airmen themselves, watched the battle
of the clouds, out of danger now that the Huns
were in retreat.</p>
<p>The machines were so high that little could be
seen, but some one had a pair of glasses and reported
that one of the German craft was disabled
and was coming down out of control.</p>
<p>This information afterward proved to be correct.
Then during the battle which followed another
German machine was set on fire; so that a
total of three were destroyed, and another of the
six engaged in the raid sent back damaged, and
one of its occupants killed.</p>
<p>Nor did the Allied planes come off scatheless.
One was shot down and both occupants killed,
while another man was wounded. But the hospital
had not been bombed, which was the great
thing.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_176' name='page_176'></a>176</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Do you wonder that I&#8217;m aching to get back
into the fight against such beasts?&#8221; asked Jerry,
when the patients had once more been carried back
to the wards, and Jerry and his chums had resumed
their conversation in a quiet place outside.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t blame you a bit,&#8221; assented Ned. &#8220;But
we were talking about Noddy Nixon.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; resumed the tall lad. &#8220;I was saying he
asked a mighty queer question of the surgeon and
I have my own opinion&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p>At that moment a smiling Red Cross nurse appeared
and said:</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a visitor asking to see you, Mr. Hopkins.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A visitor for me!&#8221; exclaimed Jerry.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, do you wish to see any one?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Man or young lady?&#8221; asked Ned, with a mischievous
smile at his chum.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, a dear, little, bald-headed man, who peers
at you in such a funny way through his big glasses
and&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Show him in!&#8221; cried Ned, Bob and Jerry in
one voice.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXII</h2>
<h3>AN UNEXPECTED CAPTURE</h3>
</div>
<p>The smiling Red Cross nurse had no need to
mention the name of the visitor. The boys knew
him for Professor Snodgrass after that description,
which could fit no one else. And the little
scientist it proved to be a moment later.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, here you are, boys!&#8221; he murmured, as
though he had just parted from them half an
hour before, and under ordinary circumstances,
instead of the great war being in the background.
&#8220;I am glad to see you. I want&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p>He made a sudden motion toward the smiling,
Red Cross nurse, and instinctively she stepped
back, with something of a look of alarm on her
face.</p>
<p>&#8220;One moment&mdash;please!&#8221; exclaimed the professor.
&#8220;There is a most beautiful and rare butterfly
on your apron. I just want it for my collection,&#8221;
and, a moment later, he had safe in one of
his wire boxes the fluttering <i>Papilio</i>.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, how beautiful!&#8221; murmured the nurse.
&#8220;What are you going to do with the poor thing?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_178' name='page_178'></a>178</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Preserve it so that others may gaze on its
beauty,&#8221; answered the professor with a bow. &#8220;It
will also aid me in my studies. This particular
butterfly is one I have long sought, because of the
peculiar markings. It is most lucky that I came
here to-day.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, it might have been unlucky if you had
happened to be hit by one of the German air
bombs,&#8221; said Jerry. &#8220;But we&#8217;re glad to see you.
We have good news for you about those two
girls.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, so I understand from your letters. So
that janitor has seen them. Well, now I must follow
them up and give them their share of the fortune.
I came on as soon as I could after hearing
from you boys. I thank you for having my interests
at heart. Now where can I see this Nick
Schmouder and have a talk with him?&#8221;</p>
<p>The camp where the German prisoners were
detained was not many miles back of the hospital
where Jerry had recovered from his wounds, and,
as he would be able to travel the next day, and as
Bob and Ned could get furloughs, it was decided
that the four should make up a party and seek
out the former janitor, so that the professor
might hear, at first hand, all there was to be said.</p>
<p>These arrangements having been made, transportation
provided and the necessary permissions
having been secured, the professor and the three
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_179' name='page_179'></a>179</span>
Motor Boys, several hours later, sat down to have
a long chat and exchange experiences. Professor
Snodgrass told how he was progressing with his
work of studying the effects of battle noises on
insects, and the boys related their stories of fighting
and battles.</p>
<p>&#8220;And we thought old Jerry was gone when we
saw him go down outside the dugout where we
captured Schmouder,&#8221; finished Ned, as a climax to
his story.</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought so myself,&#8221; admitted the tall lad.
&#8220;But I&#8217;m as well as ever, and next week I&#8217;ll be
fighting again. What are your plans, Professor?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I must try to find those two young ladies.
The military authorities have been very good to
me. They have said I can go anywhere I like to
study the insects, provided I do nothing that would
betray any army secrets. And I have been very
careful.&#8221;</p>
<p>That is he was careful not to disobey his instructions,
but that he was anything but careful
of himself the boys learned later. They heard
stories of how he went up to the very front lines
of the fighting, so he might be nearer the big
guns, and he took with him cages of insects, noting
the effect of the concussions of the great cannons
on their nervous systems.</p>
<p>Professor Snodgrass would have laughed had
you called him a brave man, but he dared as much
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_180' name='page_180'></a>180</span>
for his beloved science as others did for their
country&#8217;s honor. And, moreover, only the age
limit kept the professor out of the army.</p>
<p>The journey to the prison camp where Nick
Schmouder was held took place the next day, and
was accomplished without incident worthy of note.</p>
<p>But if Professor Snodgrass hoped to obtain
any more information from the former janitor
than the boys had about the two missing girls, he
was disappointed. For Nick Schmouder could
only repeat what he had already told. He was
glad to see Professor Snodgrass, and it was quite
pathetic to hear the man tell his story about having
always fired his gun into the ground to avoid
hurting any of those he called his friends.</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t believe there were any good Germans
in Germany any more,&#8221; said Jerry, &#8220;but I guess
Nick is pretty near one.&#8221;</p>
<p>So they listened to his stories, and Professor
Snodgrass made notes about the girls. He said
he would try to get into communication with them
through the parents of the former janitor, though
the latter did not know, himself, whether his
father and mother were still alive.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is it not terrible&mdash;awful&mdash;this war?&#8221; he cried.
&#8220;I wish all my countrymen were prisoners, and
then they could no longer fight, and we would have
peace.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, if it keeps on we&#8217;ll soon have most of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_181' name='page_181'></a>181</span>
the Kaiser&#8217;s army in a cage like this,&#8221; declared
Ned. &#8220;Don&#8217;t worry&mdash;we&#8217;re going to make a good
clean-up of it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope you do,&#8221; said Schmouder, and many of
his fellow prisoners agreed with him.</p>
<p>At present all the professor could do was to
depend on some message getting to the missing
girls. As they were not prisoners of war it was
thought that perhaps some missive might reach
them, though all ordinary communication between
Americans and Germany was held up.</p>
<p>The girls, though of Swedish parentage, were
citizens of the United States, as the fathers of
both were naturalized; therefore, the diplomatic
channels of Sweden were closed to them, as the
money had been left in Professor Snodgrass&#8217; care.
The Red Cross might aid, as a last resort, and if
that failed all that could be done was to wait until
after the war and then seek them out, if the two
nieces were still alive.</p>
<p>So, having dispatched several letters by different
routes, Professor Snodgrass prepared to spend
some time with the boys.</p>
<p>&#8220;I might as well study the effect here of noises
on insects, as to go back where I was,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;Here I shall be nearer those two young ladies, if
I can ever find a chance to reach them. We are
heading toward Metz, are we not?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, and we&#8217;ll get there,&#8221; declared Jerry, for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_182' name='page_182'></a>182</span>
by this time enough of General Pershing&#8217;s plans
had developed to show that his armies had this
town for one of its objectives. But there was
still a long way to go.</p>
<p>True to his determination, Jerry went back to
the front with his chums, and Professor Snodgrass,
by virtue of special permission, accompanied
them. The chums were welcomed by their
comrades, and once more took up the life of the
trenches.</p>
<p>It was one afternoon, just before time for them
to be relieved, that Ned, Bob, and Jerry had their
attention drawn to a stretch of No Man&#8217;s Land
in front of them, by hearing some of their comrades
say:</p>
<p>&#8220;Look at the bug-hunter! What in the name
of Billie Bejinks is he doing out there? He&#8217;ll be
bowled over by a German bullet just as sure as
guns!&#8221;</p>
<p>The three lads looked, and, to their surprise
and horror, saw Professor Snodgrass with something
supported on his back and partly in his arms,
walking across No Man&#8217;s Land in the direction
of the German trenches as unconcernedly as
though peace had been declared.</p>
<p>&#8220;Look at him!&#8221; yelled Ned.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve got to get him back!&#8221; cried Jerry.</p>
<p>An officer, who had heard the commotion, came
in from the nearest dugout and asked:</p>
<p>&#8220;Who gave him permission to go out there?
Is he deserting?&#8221;</p>

THEY MARCHED STRAIGHT FOR THE AMERICAN LINES.<br />

<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_183' name='page_183'></a>183</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Indeed he isn&#8217;t, Sir,&#8221; answered Ned. &#8220;I guess
he must be trying some experiment, or looking
for bugs.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well it&#8217;s likely to be his last experiment,&#8221; was
the grim comment, &#8220;and about all he&#8217;ll find will
be bullets. Ah, I was afraid so. Look, they are
going to capture him!&#8221;</p>
<p>As he spoke the Americans, crouching in their
trench, saw three German soldiers leap out of
their ditch and advance toward the professor.
But the latter did not seem in the least afraid.
He walked on, for a moment not observing his
enemies, who were approaching from one side.
Then suddenly he noticed them.</p>
<p>But he did not run, nor did he show any sign
of fear, and then the most unexpected thing happened.
The Germans suddenly dropped their
rifles. Up in the air went their hands, and then
they turned and marched straight for the American
lines, the professor following behind, and
fairly driving them on in some mysterious way.
He had made a most unexpected capture.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIII</h2>
<h3>GREAT PREPARATIONS</h3>
</div>
<p>Watching him from the security of their
trench, Ned, Bob, and Jerry, their comrades, and
the officers on duty, could scarcely believe their
eyes as they saw what had happened. Yet there
was no delusion about it. Professor Snodgrass,
rashly venturing across No Man&#8217;s Land toward
the German trenches, was coming back and with
three prisoners. As Bob said afterward, it was
like the advertisements of the circus which boasted
of three rings and innumerable clowns.</p>
<p>&#8220;Three prisoners! Count &#8217;em. Three!&#8221; Bob
yelled.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, for the love of hot chocolate!&#8221; cried
Jerry, &#8220;what does it mean?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Search me!&#8221; answered Ned, succinctly.
&#8220;Looks as if he had &#8217;em hypnotized!&#8221;</p>
<p>And so it did, for the Huns, as they came
nearer, wore on their faces looks of stupefied
astonishment.</p>
<p>Straight for the trench where his young friends
were, Professor Snodgrass marched his prisoners.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_185' name='page_185'></a>185</span>
He was in great danger, but he did not seem to
mind that, or even be aware of it. Doubtless it
was the latter, but, as a matter of fact, he was
within range of the big guns, as well as within shot
of rifles or machine guns.</p>
<p>Of course, though, had the Germans opened
fire on the professor from their trenches, they
would have run the chance of killing their own
three men, captives though the latter were. And,
too, had the Huns fired there would have at once
been answering fire from the Americans, for the
latter gunners were always on the alert, and once
word was passed up and down the line that the
little &#8220;bug-hunter&#8221; was out in No Man&#8217;s Land,
every man who knew or who had heard of him
was ready with his rifle&mdash;Ned, Bob and Jerry
among them&mdash;ready to take full toll in revenge
had he been fired on.</p>
<p>But the German trenches were silent, and for
good reason, as was learned later, so the professor
marched on with his prisoners, the latter never
once looking behind them, but walking with their
hands high in the air.</p>
<p>And the little scientist was as unconcerned as
though he was on his return from some insect-hunting
trip. His appearance was a bit unusual,
though, and Ned commented on it.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s that thing on his back?&#8221; asked the
stout lad.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_186' name='page_186'></a>186</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Looks like a magnified haversack of new design,&#8221;
replied Ned.</p>
<p>&#8220;The professor hasn&#8217;t enlisted, has he?&#8221; some
one asked Jerry. &#8220;Not but what he&#8217;d make a fine
soldier,&#8221; was the added comment.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I can&#8217;t imagine what he has on,&#8221; Jerry
answered. &#8220;We&#8217;ll soon find out, though.&#8221;</p>
<p>On came the professor, and when he had his
prisoners at the edge of the first American trench
he exclaimed, with a twinkle in his eyes:</p>
<p>&#8220;Here you are! Make yourselves at home!
Will some one please take charge of&mdash;er&mdash;these&mdash;specimens?&#8221;
asked the little scientist, and again
his eyes twinkled as he looked at the lieutenant
who was in command just then.</p>
<p>&#8220;Great guns, man alive! Did you go out to
get them?&#8221; asked the officer.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, not exactly,&#8221; was the reply. &#8220;These
men tried to interfere with me in my work, and I
simply told them to mind their own business and
get out of the way. Bringing them over here
seemed the easiest way to get rid of them, so I
marched them along. Now I will go back and
finish&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, no! Excuse me for seeming to be brusk
and arbitrary,&#8221; said the lieutenant smiling, &#8220;but
I can&#8217;t permit you to go back. For our own sake,
as well as yours. You might precipitate a general
engagement, and while we&#8217;re not running away
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_187' name='page_187'></a>187</span>
from anything like that, we are not looking for it
just now. Please stay here.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Very well, I will,&#8221; mildly agreed the professor.
&#8220;Perhaps I can as well continue my studies
here. But what shall I do with my&mdash;my specimens?&#8221;
and he nodded toward the Germans.</p>
<p>The prisoners were still standing with uplifted
hands, gazing at the professor as if the issue of
life and death depended on him as far as they were
concerned.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tell them they may put down their hands,&#8221;
begged the professor of the lieutenant. &#8220;They&#8217;re
in your charge now, and you had better give them
orders. Besides, I don&#8217;t speak their language very
well.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then how in the world did you get them to
surrender?&#8221; asked the officer. &#8220;How did you,
alone, without a gun or a sword, or even a hand
grenade, capture three Germans?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I fancy it was due to this,&#8221; and the professor
motioned to the strange contrivance on his
back. &#8220;I threatened them with total annihilation
if they didn&#8217;t do as I said and march for these
trenches, and they did. Whether they understood
me or not I don&#8217;t know. But up went their hands
and on they came.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, they came on all right,&#8221; said the lieutenant.
&#8220;We saw that. But still I don&#8217;t understand.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_188' name='page_188'></a>188</span></p>
<p>At this one of the prisoners spoke.</p>
<p>&#8220;Haf ve der lieutnant&#8217;s bermission to lower our
hants?&#8221; he asked, speaking with a deep, guttural
accent.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said the officer curtly. &#8220;But first we&#8217;ll
search you. Go through them,&#8221; he ordered one
of his men, and when an automatic pistol and
several hand grenades had been taken from each
of the prisoners, their hands were allowed to
come down. They uttered sighs of relief.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, how did it happen?&#8221; went on the officer.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ve surrender to suberior force, und dot iss no
disgrace,&#8221; said the German soldier who had first
spoken. &#8220;Ven ve saw der little man ve try to
capture him. But he turned on us, und by der&mdash;vot
you call machine&mdash;on his back mit total destruction
threatened us. As ve did not vant to
die&mdash;vell, ve surrendered. Dot&#8217;s all!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Ja!</i>&#8221; murmured his two companions.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I guess that is all,&#8221; said the lieutenant,
smiling grimly. &#8220;Take &#8217;em to the rear, to the
temporary prisoner-cage,&#8221; he ordered one of his
men. And then, when the Germans, with a last
wondering and fearful look at the professor, had
gone, the lieutenant, turning to the scientist, asked
with a smile:</p>
<p>&#8220;What sort of infernal machine have you there,
anyhow? Does it generate a new kind of gas?&#8221;</p>
<p>The professor laughed and unslung the apparatus
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_189' name='page_189'></a>189</span>
from his back, where it was carried by means
of straps, like those on a haversack.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, it isn&#8217;t a gas machine,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It&#8217;s just
a little apparatus for taking moving pictures of insects.
It&#8217;s as harmless as the chocolate sodas my
friend Bob likes so well. I got it up to take views
of grasshoppers and crickets, and I wanted to get
some pictures this morning of those insects showing
them as they hopped about normally. Then,
later, I intended to set the machine out in the open
space, and leave it there when heavy firing was
going on. I hoped to get contrasting pictures
then, and show the effect, if any, of the sound of
big guns on the creatures. But those Germans
spoiled my plans.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And I fancy you spoiled theirs,&#8221; said the lieutenant
with a laugh. &#8220;So you threatened them
with your moving-picture machine, did you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I couldn&#8217;t think of anything else to do
when I saw them confronting me. So I yelled
that my machine was a new product of the war,
and that unless they did exactly as I said I would
at once destroy them, even down to their finger
nails, by a blast of terrible fire from the machine.
Fortunately they understood my very poor German,
mixed with English as it was.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, very fortunately,&#8221; said the lieutenant.
&#8220;We saw them drop their guns and raise their
hands, and couldn&#8217;t understand. But your machine,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_190' name='page_190'></a>190</span>
harmless as it is, doubtless impressed them
as very dangerous.&#8221;</p>
<p>When Ned, Bob, and Jerry, as well as the others,
looked at the apparatus, they could understand
why an ignorant man, accustomed to obey
and do no thinking, took the picture machine for
some terrible engine of war. The Motor Boys
themselves had not seen it before, as the professor
carried it in sections in his luggage, and had
only fitted it together and used it that day.</p>
<p>It consisted of a black box, with numerous wires,
wheels, levers and projecting tubes. These latter
contained lenses and shutters, but the Germans
must have imagined devastating fire could spout
from them. And so they had surrendered.</p>
<p>&#8220;But I can&#8217;t understand why the others in the
trenches didn&#8217;t open fire on you,&#8221; said the officer.</p>
<p>They learned, later, the reason for this. It was
because the Germans had retired from that particular
part of the line. Whether for strategic
reasons, or otherwise, could not be learned, but
the three prisoners admitted that they, alone, had
been left in the trench.</p>
<p>Their orders were to remain quiet, and not to
attack, but if the Americans came out of their
trenches in force the German sentries were to fire
their rifles, as many hand grenades and machine-gun
rounds as possible, and then retreat, if they
could, to the next line of trenches.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_191' name='page_191'></a>191</span></p>
<p>But when Professor Snodgrass approached the
lines alone, the Germans, instead of firing, thought
they would capture him, and so the trio advanced
stealthily on the scientist. The result has been
seen.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, it was a great piece of work,&#8221; declared
the lieutenant. &#8220;Not only the capture, but because
we learned that the Germans are falling
back. This may change our plans somewhat. I
must report to headquarters. And you, Professor
Snodgrass, had better come with me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But what about my insects?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They will have to wait, I&#8217;m afraid. Besides,
there will be no heavy firing now. Later&mdash;well,
I&#8217;m afraid I can&#8217;t tell you of that now. It&#8217;s a
secret. But I think you&#8217;ll soon have a chance to
hear all the heavy firing you want.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I wonder what he meant?&#8221; asked Ned, of his
chums, as the professor, returning his &#8220;infernal&#8221;
insect moving-picture machine to his quarters went
away with the officer.</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe we&#8217;re going to make a big attack,&#8221; suggested
Bob.</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps,&#8221; assented Jerry. &#8220;I heard some
rumors of it. Well, we&#8217;ll have to wait and see.&#8221;</p>
<p>They did not have to wait long, for that day
began preparations which, to those who understood,
indicated that a great attack was imminent.</p>
<p>Great stores of shell and ammunition were
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_192' name='page_192'></a>192</span>
brought up under cover of darkness to the firing
line. Big guns were shifted in position and well
camouflaged. And there also arrived at the front
where the Motor Boys were stationed several batteries
of those wonderful French seventy-fives,
those guns which did so much to win the war, the
secret of which the Germans tried in vain to
learn.</p>
<p>It was after several days of hard work, during
which they saw little of Professor Snodgrass, that
Bob, seeking out his chums one afternoon, said:</p>
<p>&#8220;Guess what&#8217;s up!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t,&#8221; Ned replied.</p>
<p>&#8220;Go on! Tell us!&#8221; cried Jerry.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re going to have a lot of doughnuts and
chocolate candy!&#8221; cried Bob.</p>
<p>&#8220;Doughnuts!&#8221; shouted Jerry.</p>
<p>&#8220;Chocolate!&#8221; echoed Ned. &#8220;Where is it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Safe,&#8221; laughed Chunky. &#8220;I struck a Salvation
Army man with an extra supply and I took
all he&#8217;d give me. They&#8217;re hidden in the trench,
near where we go on duty, and to-night we&#8217;ll have
a feast!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Good for you, Chunky!&#8221; cried Jerry. &#8220;I always
said you were all right!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Same here!&#8221; added Ned.</p>
<p>And that night, when the three chums were
about to go on duty in the dismal trenches, Bob
led them to a little place he had hollowed out
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_193' name='page_193'></a>193</span>
under a rock, and lined with boards. It was a
hiding place known to all three.</p>
<p>&#8220;We can stick the stuff in our pockets,&#8221; he said,
&#8220;and eat it when we get hungry. Things are so
upset, getting ready for a big offensive, I guess,
that maybe the rations won&#8217;t come up on time.
But we&#8217;ll be fixed, anyhow.&#8221;</p>
<p>He opened the secret place, and then, as he
reached his hand in and drew it out empty, a queer
look came over his face.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter?&#8221; asked Jerry.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s gone!&#8221; faltered Bob.</p>
<p>Consternation showed on the faces of all three.
Ned and Jerry made a careful examination of the
hiding place after Bob. There was no doubt of
it&mdash;the treasure was gone! And sweets were
really a treasure to the men in the trenches.</p>
<p>&#8220;Who took &#8217;em?&#8221; faltered Bob.</p>
<p>Jerry looked about, flashed his electric pocket
lamp, for the trenches were in the shadow now.
Suddenly he picked up a knife, and, as he held it
in his hand, he exclaimed:</p>
<p>&#8220;Noddy Nixon&#8217;s! He&#8217;s been up to his rotten
tricks again!&#8221;</p>
<hr class='major' />

<h2>CHAPTER XXIV</h2>
<h3>&#8220;S. I. W.&#8221;</h3>
</div>
<p>There seemed no doubt on the subject, at
least in the minds of the three Motor Boys. Bob
knew full well that he had left the treat of sweet
things in the hole in the wall of his trench. Now
the hole was empty, and a knife with Noddy Nixon&#8217;s
name on it was picked up at the very spot.
It surely indicated that Noddy had been there,
and it needed no very discerning mind, after one
was acquainted with the character of Nixon, to
say that he was the guilty one.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;ll we do?&#8221; gasped Bob.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s go and accuse him and get the stuff
away!&#8221; suggested Ned. &#8220;Maybe he hasn&#8217;t eaten
it all yet.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not much chance but what he has,&#8221; commented
Jerry. &#8220;It wouldn&#8217;t last long with him
and his crowd. Still I&#8217;m in favor of letting him
know we&#8217;re on to his game. Let&#8217;s go and have
it out with him.&#8221;</p>
<p>But this was not to be. Just as the three chums
were about to go from their part of the trench to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_195' name='page_195'></a>195</span>
that where Noddy Nixon was stationed, the signal
sounded for Ned, Bob, and Jerry to take their
places on official duty.</p>
<p>&#8220;Too late!&#8221; exclaimed Bob. &#8220;We can&#8217;t reach
him now, and he&#8217;ll eat it all up.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The pig!&#8221; muttered Ned.</p>
<p>And they had to let the matter rest there.
They could not ask to be relieved from trench
sentry work to go and get back, possibly, doughnuts
and chocolate stolen by Noddy Nixon. It
was too trivial a matter from a military standpoint,
though to Ned, Bob, and Jerry, forced to
be on duty during the long, wet, dreary night, it
meant a great deal.</p>
<p>But it was another of the fortunes of war, and
it had to be borne.</p>
<p>However, it was not as bad as it might have
been, for during the night a relief party came
along with hot chocolate, and this was grateful to
the lads in the trenches.</p>
<p>&#8220;But I&#8217;ll have it out with Noddy to-day!&#8221; declared
Bob as he and his chums went off duty in
the morning. &#8220;I&#8217;ll turn him upside down; that&#8217;s
what I&#8217;ll do!&#8221;</p>
<p>But again his plans went astray, for orders
came from headquarters, shifting many of the
regiments, and the three friends found themselves
on the move, without a chance to see Noddy.</p>
<p>&#8220;But his company moves, too,&#8221; declared Ned,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_196' name='page_196'></a>196</span>
who had made some inquiries. &#8220;He&#8217;s in the same
division we are, and we&#8217;ll see him when we get
settled again.&#8221;</p>
<p>But they did not see Noddy Nixon again for
some time, though they heard of him, and under
tragic circumstances.</p>
<p>The guess the boys had made about a great
offensive was a correct one. The time had come
for the turning point in the war, and the backward
movement of the British and French was
about to stop. The American forces were increasing,
and now General Foch was able to put into
practice the strategy he had so long waited for.
He could attack, and with great hope of succeeding.
The turning point had been reached.</p>
<p>There were rumors and all sorts of stories floating
around the camp. Ned, Bob and Jerry had
been moved to the north and farther toward the
great Hindenburg line which was so soon to be
pierced, impregnable though the Germans boasted
it.</p>
<p>Professor Snodgrass, too, managed, by means
of some influence he possessed, to be allowed to
accompany that part of the army to which his
young friends were attached. He had not ceased
his efforts to locate the two girls, but he realized,
as did Jerry and his chums, that it was an almost
hopeless proceeding now. However, there was
still the study of explosive noises on insects to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_197' name='page_197'></a>197</span>
which the professor could devote himself, and he
did.</p>
<p>The boys noted, however, that the strain of his
uncertain financial situation was telling on the
little man. Cheerful as always, and seemingly
oblivious to practical affairs, yet there was at times
a strained look about his eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he said one day in answer to a question
Jerry put, &#8220;I have enough for my immediate
needs. If I do not get back what I lent to my old
friend&mdash;and I may even lose more, as I endorsed
a note for him to cover a loan from another&mdash;and
if I cannot use what Professor Petersen left
me, I shall have before long to give up my work
here, however. And, of course, the trip to the
Amazon and the investigations there must be
given up.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am sorry, Professor. Can&#8217;t we&#8211;&#8211;&#8221; began
Jerry.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tut, tut!&#8221; interrupted Professor Snodgrass,
with a kindly smile. &#8220;We&#8217;ll no doubt find the
girls&mdash;I hope so for their sake as well as my own&mdash;and
perhaps my friend may be able to adjust
his affairs, though I fear&#8211;&#8211;Poor man, poor
Albert! It will be a dreadful thing for him to
lose all he has and be compelled to start the world
over again at his age.&#8221; And Professor Snodgrass
walked away, his personal trouble forgotten
in sympathy with his friend, the very man who
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_198' name='page_198'></a>198</span>
was the cause of his own anxieties and probable
losses.</p>
<p>Vast were the preparations that went on for
the advance against the enemy. Never was there
such a collection of cannon, large and small.
Never was there such a store of powder and shell.
The back lines were like a hundred arsenals
turned into one. Food, too, there was in great
quantities, for it has been well said that an army
fights on its stomach, and there must be no lack of
nourishment when the troops went forward, as
they were destined to do.</p>
<p>All these war-like preparations the three chums
noted with every manifestation of delight. They
wanted to whip the Hun, and whip him well, and
all this argued for success. The soldiers knew
they would be well backed-up as they went forward,
and forward they were going.</p>
<p>Orders were given that every man must look
well to himself personally&mdash;to his uniform, his
belongings, and his weapons. All gas masks were
tested, and those in use for some time, or which
showed the least defect, were thrown away and
new ones issued. There must be no holding up
of the advance once it had begun, because of poison
gas. And it could not be doubted but what
the Germans would use it lavishly.</p>
<p>Rifles and hand grenades, likewise, were looked
to. Everything must be in readiness so there
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_199' name='page_199'></a>199</span>
would not be an instant of unnecessary delay. But
it was the store of cannon and ammunition back
of the firing lines that was most amazing.</p>
<p>The three chums, being sent on duty to the rear
one day, had a chance to observe some of the
measures being taken there to insure the defeat
of the Kaiser&#8217;s troops. The ground was fairly
covered with ammunition boxes and shells&mdash;well
concealed from hostile airmen, of course, even
had they been able to pass that far to the rear.
And the guns, large and small, lined up ready for
the forward movement, were wheel to wheel for
miles and miles in extent. The greatest artillery
firing in the history of the world was about to take
place.</p>
<p>&#8220;If the professor wants to see the effect of a
rattle-te-bang on his bugs he&#8217;ll soon get his
chance,&#8221; said Jerry, and his chums could only
agree with him.</p>
<p>&#8220;I only wish one thing,&#8221; remarked Bob, as they
prepared to go back to the front, after having
accomplished their mission.</p>
<p>&#8220;What?&#8221; asked Ned.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d like to have it out with Noddy Nixon before
the big show. I just want to get one whack
at him for taking our wood and those doughnuts
and cakes of chocolate. Just one whack!&#8221;</p>
<p>But this &#8220;whack&#8221; Bob was destined never to
have.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_200' name='page_200'></a>200</span></p>
<p>They again went on duty in the trenches. The
day of the great offensive was approaching.</p>
<p>Suddenly a shot rang out in the sector near the
three Motor Boys. They started, and Ned exclaimed:</p>
<p>&#8220;Can that be the signal for the attack?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, it doesn&#8217;t begin until to-morrow,&#8221; said
Jerry. &#8220;That&#8217;s one of our own men. Guess his
rifle went off by accident.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was a little excitement, but what had
caused it the boys could not learn at the time, as
they must stay at their posts. But a little later,
when their lieutenant came through the trench,
Ned, saluting, asked:</p>
<p>&#8220;Did one of our sharpshooters get a Hun,
Sir?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; was the answer. &#8220;It wasn&#8217;t that. Private
Nixon was shot.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Noddy Nixon shot!&#8221; gasped Bob. &#8220;How?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;S. I. W.,&#8221; was the terse reply of the officer,
as he passed on.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXV</h2>
<h3>THE BLACK BOX</h3>
</div>
<p>The three chums, standing in the wet and
muddy trench, looked at one another as this significant
remark was made. Bob either did not
catch what was said, or did not understand, for
he asked his companions:</p>
<p>&#8220;What did he say?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;S. I. W.,&#8221; repeated Jerry.</p>
<p>&#8220;Self-inflicted wound,&#8221; translated Ned. &#8220;So
Noddy Nixon did that to himself to get out of the
big battle! Well, it&#8217;s just like the coward! I&#8217;m
glad he isn&#8217;t in our company!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So am I,&#8221; added Jerry.</p>
<p>&#8220;Self-inflicted wound,&#8221; repeated Bob.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, he&#8217;s out of the fighting now,&#8221; declared
Ned, &#8220;though he&#8217;ll have the worst time he ever had
in his life. He&#8217;d better be dead by a Hun shell.&#8221;</p>
<p>Silence fell upon the three in the trench while,
not far from them, they could hear the commotion
caused as Noddy was taken away to a hospital.
And there, for some time, he remained safely if
not comfortably in bed, while his companions endured
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_202' name='page_202'></a>202</span>
the mud and the blood of the trenches,
meeting death and wounds, or just escaping them
by a hair&#8217;s breadth to drive back the hordes of the
Boches.</p>
<p>But over Noddy&#8217;s cot, and over that of several
men on either side of him was a placard with
the significant letters:</p>
<table style='margin: auto' summary=''><tr><td>
<p style='margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0;'>
<i>S. I. W.</i></p>
</td></tr></table>
<p>&#8220;Self-inflicted wound.&#8221; One of the most terrible
tragedies of the war&mdash;more tragic, even,
than the death of the gallant boys on the day the
armistice was signed, yes, within an hour of it.
For those letters indicated a disgrace that seldom,
if ever, could be wiped out.</p>
<p>Briefly it meant that a soldier afraid of going
into action with his comrades, went to some secluded
place and, aiming his gun or pistol at some
extremity&mdash;a hand or a foot&mdash;where a wound was
likely to be slight and not very painful, pulled the
trigger. Then followed the story that a stray
German bullet, coming over the top of the trench
as the man exposed himself, had done the deed.</p>
<p>But the nature of the wound, the character of
the bullet, and, above all, the appearance of the
man himself, told the real story. Sometimes the
victims would say their weapon went off by accident
as they were cleaning it, and this was perhaps
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_203' name='page_203'></a>203</span>
worst of all, for it put the canker of doubt
into genuine cases of this sort, and there are bound
to be some such in every army.</p>
<p>So Noddy was carried away to the hospital, and
&#8220;S. I. W.&#8221; was inscribed over his cot.</p>
<p>As to the causes leading up to the self-inflicted
wounds they are many and varied. Sometimes a
soldier may become fear-crazed, and irresponsible
for his act. Other men are just plain &#8220;yellow,&#8221;
clear through, and ought never to have gone into
the fighting. They should have confessed cowardice
at first, though, of course, that would be hard.</p>
<p>Sometimes, though rarely, these &#8220;S. I. W.&#8221;
cases &#8220;came back.&#8221; That is, they were given a
chance to redeem themselves and went to the fighting
front with a song on their lips and undaunted
courage in their eyes. And then, if they died doing
their duty they were absolved. But it was a
desperate chance.</p>
<p>Every one recognized that there was an element
of doubt in these cases, but as for Noddy
Nixon, when his significant question to the surgeon
as to the relative pain of a hand or foot
wound was recalled, he was condemned already.
He had shot himself slightly in the left foot. He
was dishonorably discharged when he was cured,
and sent home, and, therefore, did not trouble the
Motor Boys again, nor did Bob get his revenge
for the stolen articles.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_204' name='page_204'></a>204</span></p>
<p>Ned, Bob, and Jerry did not feel much like
talking after they learned what had happened.
They had no love for Noddy Nixon, and he had
treated them exceedingly badly in the past, as well
as tormenting them since they had been associated
in the army. But they knew that nothing they
could have done or said would have been half as
effective punishment as that which he had brought
on himself. Henceforth, among decent men, he
was an outcast; a pariah.</p>
<p>The long night passed. Sentries were changed,
a watch was kept to forestall any attack on the
part of the Germans, but none came. Save for the
occasional clash of a night patrol, or the false
alarm of some one on listening post, there was
little action during the hours preceding the great
offensive.</p>
<p>Their tour of duty ended, Ned, Bob, and Jerry
sought rest in the dugout. There, with but few
more comforts than in the trenches, they waited
until the time should come again for them to go
out and take a &#8220;mud bath,&#8221; as Ned called it.</p>
<p>For it rained often, and the trenches never
seemed to dry. Still at this stage of the war there
were more comforts for the men on the firing line
than when France and England first opposed the
advance of the gray hordes.</p>
<p>&#8220;When does the big show start?&#8221; asked Ned,
as he and his chums came out of the dugout for a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_205' name='page_205'></a>205</span>
few hours&#8217; stay farther behind the lines. &#8220;I
thought the bombardment was to begin this morning.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Must be delayed for some reason,&#8221; said Jerry
with a yawn. &#8220;Come on, let&#8217;s go somewhere and
sit down. We&#8217;ll know when it&#8217;s time for the
shindig to start.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s see if we can find the professor,&#8221; suggested
Bob. &#8220;We may have hard work to get
word to him after the fighting begins.&#8221;</p>
<p>This seemed a good plan, and it was followed.
Professor Snodgrass was billeted temporarily in
a farmhouse on the edge of a little French village
near which the boys were on duty. Thither they
went, and found their friend poring over books
and papers.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, how goes it?&#8221; asked Jerry, after they
had all shaken hands.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, indeed,&#8221; was the answer. &#8220;I have not
yet found the young ladies, but I expect to, soon.
I have heard that Mr. Schmouder, the father of
the janitor, who was looking after them, and who
knew something of their plans, moved from his
home town, outside of Metz, lately, and started
farther back into Germany.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then I should think it would be harder than
ever for you to trace them,&#8221; suggested Ned.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I think it will be easier,&#8221; said the professor,
but he did not explain how.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_206' name='page_206'></a>206</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Getting the results you expected from the insect
noise campaign, Professor?&#8221; asked Jerry.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, my boy. It is a complete success. I even
have some moving pictures taken with my new machine
that helped me capture the Germans. Wait,
and I will show you.&#8221;</p>
<p>He seemed as cheerful as though no cloud of
financial trouble hung over his head and as though
the World War were being fought to give him
opportunity to test the effect of noise on the crickets.
He turned to a table in his room, and began
delving in a mass of things. To get at something
he wanted to exhibit to the boys, he set in the middle
of the floor a small, black box.</p>
<p>Just as he did that a soldier, evidently an officer
of some kind in the French army, stepped into
the room, and in a mixture of French and English
asked if Professor Snodgrass was there.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am he,&#8221; answered the scientist.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, zen you will please come with me,&#8221; said
the soldier. &#8220;You are wanted at ze headquarters.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wanted at headquarters!&#8221; repeated the professor.
&#8220;What for?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Zis will explain,&#8221; and the officer handed a note
to Professor Snodgrass.</p>
<p>As the professor read it a smile came over his
face.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, I understand,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I will come at
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_207' name='page_207'></a>207</span>
once. Boys, we will let the insect pictures wait a
minute. Perhaps you will be interested in my latest
discovery. Come, I am ready to go,&#8221; and he
picked up the black box from the floor and stood
in waiting.</p>
<p>The officer looked a little dubiously at the object
in the professor&#8217;s hand, and then at the three
boys.</p>
<p>&#8220;My orders did not include&mdash;<i>zem</i>!&#8221; he said, indicating
Ned, Bob, and Jerry, &#8220;nor&mdash;<i>zat</i>!&#8221; and
he pointed to the box.</p>
<p>&#8220;This has to come,&#8221; replied the professor. &#8220;It
is part of what I proposed. As for my friends, I
will be responsible for them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Very well, sair!&#8221; and the Frenchman bowed
and led the way.</p>
<p>Wonderingly the boys followed Professor
Snodgrass, and presently found themselves at field
headquarters. A company of French soldiers
were standing about, and while waiting for the
summons to the presence of the headquarters officer
who had sent for him, Professor Snodgrass
set down on the ground the black box he had
brought.</p>
<p>Then he suddenly saw a curious insect crawling
along and became intent on its capture. The boys
were watching him and paid no attention to the
black box until they heard some one yell:</p>
<p>&#8220;Look out, boys! It&#8217;s an infernal machine in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_208' name='page_208'></a>208</span>
there&mdash;a bomb! He&#8217;s a spy and he&#8217;s going to
blow up the whole place. It&#8217;s an infernal machine&mdash;I
can hear the buzzing of the battery inside.&#8221;</p>
<p>An American soldier, who had approached the
box and had leaned over to inspect it, leaped away
and began running as he cried out his warning.
There was consternation among the officers and
men outside the headquarters building, and Professor
Snodgrass, pausing in his search for the
elusive insect, gazed up in surprise at the commotion.</p>
<p>&#8220;What has happened?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Some one says there&#8217;s a bomb in that black
box of yours,&#8221; explained Jerry.</p>
<p>&#8220;If there is, get it out of the way! Douse it
in water. Throw it away. Look out!&#8221; yelled several.</p>
<p>One or two soldiers started for the black box,
and others with ready bayonets for the professor,
for there had been a number of spies discovered
of late in that sector.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t touch that box!&#8221; cried the professor.
&#8220;Don&#8217;t open it! Keep away from it!&#8221;</p>
<p>And, as he hurried toward it, the soldiers
leaped back.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVI</h2>
<h3>A DISAPPEARANCE</h3>
</div>
<p>&#8220;Halt!&#8221;</p>
<p>It was the ringing voice of one of the officers
speaking, and so sharp was the tone that even Professor
Snodgrass paused in his movement toward
the black box.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t go any further,&#8221; went on the officer,
who stood dominating the scene. &#8220;Some one secure
that man, and then we&#8217;ll dispose of the box.
Take good care of him!&#8221; and he pointed to the
scientist.</p>
<p>Ned Slade, Bob Baker, and Jerry Hopkins
looked in astonishment at one another. What
could it all mean?</p>
<p>&#8220;Zere must be some mistake,&#8221; said the French
officer who had escorted the professor to headquarters.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mistake? No!&#8221; exclaimed the American officer
who had ordered a halt in the proceedings.
&#8220;But it would be a mistake if we let him get near
that black box. I heard all that was said. If that
is a bomb the best way to let him carry out his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_210' name='page_210'></a>210</span>
plan would be to set it going, even if he destroyed
himself. Some spies are capable of that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Spy!&#8221; cried Jerry, instinctively, forgetting that
he was speaking to a superior officer. &#8220;Professor
Snodgrass isn&#8217;t a spy!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I am sure he is not!&#8221;</p>
<p>This was another officer speaking, one well
known to the professor, and who knew him. In
fact, it was this officer who had summoned the
former instructor of Boxwood Hall to headquarters.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t arrest the professor,&#8221; went on the latter
officer. &#8220;As for his black box, handle it just as he
tells you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But, Colonel Lacombe,&#8221; protested the officer
who had interfered in the proceedings. &#8220;Surely
you&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I understand it perfectly, Major Dustan,&#8221; was
the smiling reply. &#8220;I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ll find it all a
mistake when I explain, or rather, when Professor
Snodgrass explains. That is why I sent for him.
Will you come this way, if you please, Professor?
And bring the black box&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p>At that instant the little scientist, who appeared
to have recovered his composure on the appearance
of his friend, the colonel, pointed to the black
box which, all this while, had remained on the
ground in front of the group of headquarters
buildings.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_211' name='page_211'></a>211</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Look out!&#8221; shouted Professor Snodgrass.
&#8220;The box has been opened by mistake. They&#8217;re
coming out! Run, everybody!&#8221;</p>
<p>Turning, he caught hold of Bob, who was nearest
him, and began pulling him along.</p>
<p>The flight of the professor was contagious.
Every one near turned and fled, and Jerry, looking
over his shoulder, saw what seemed to be a black
cloud of smoke coming from the black box.</p>
<p>The heart of the tall, young soldier seemed to
fail him. After all, had a mistake been made?
Was it possible that a spy was using the innocent
and sometimes absent-minded professor for some
base and terrible end? Could there have been a
substitution made, and one of the harmless boxes
of the scientist exchanged for a deadly bomb
which he had, unwittingly, introduced at headquarters,
so that, exploding, it might kill a number
of valuable officers?</p>
<p>These thoughts flashed through Jerry&#8217;s mind
as he ran along beside Ned. The black cloud
from the box was becoming more dense.</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe it&#8217;s only a smoke bomb,&#8221; thought
Jerry. &#8220;Or perhaps the powder, or whatever is
in it, has become wet, because of so much rain,
and is only burning instead of exploding. I hope
so.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then came a yell from some one. It was followed
by several other cries of physical distress.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_212' name='page_212'></a>212</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe it&#8217;s a new kind of poison gas the Germans
have taken this means to set off,&#8221; mused
Jerry as he leaped along. &#8220;But I don&#8217;t smell anything.
Could it be possible that spies have played
this trick on the professor?&#8221;</p>
<p>Jerry well knew that even with all his absent-mindedness
and his blind devotion to science, that
Professor Snodgrass would never, willingly, do
anything to harm the Allied cause.</p>
<p>And yet&#8211;&#8211;</p>
<p>More yells came from the soldiers that had
been gathered around the black box and who
fled when Professor Snodgrass gave the alarm.
And the yells began to come from some of the
officers, too. They were not above giving vent
to either pain or surprise.</p>
<p>And then suddenly Jerry felt a sharp pain on
the back of his neck. At first he thought it might
have come from some missile, discharged noiselessly
from the black box. He clapped his hand
to the seat of the pain and at once became aware
that he had struck and crushed some small insect.
It came away in his hand, twisting and curling in
its death agony, and the pain in Jerry&#8217;s neck increased.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why!&#8221; he cried as he saw the bug. &#8220;Why,
it&#8217;s a wasp! A wasp!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course it is!&#8221; said Professor Snodgrass,
flapping his arms about his head, and Jerry now
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_213' name='page_213'></a>213</span>
saw the reason. A number of vicious wasps were
buzzing about them.</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re wasps, with the worst stings of any I
ever saw!&#8221; yelled the professor. &#8220;That&#8217;s why I
want to get away. I was stung by one of them
once, and I&#8217;ll never forget it. Look out! Here
come more of &#8217;em!&#8221;</p>
<p>There was a cloud of the wasps flying about
Bob, Jerry, and the professor now, and the tall lad
noted that the insects were also hovering around
other soldiers and officers. There was a black
cloud of them near the small case that had caused
such a scare.</p>
<p>&#8220;Was that what was in the black box?&#8221; asked
Jerry, as he dodged a wasp that seemed about to
alight on his nose.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. Wasps,&#8221; asserted the scientist. &#8220;The
most war-like wasps I have been able to discover
in this part of Europe. They are a cross breed
of the <i>Vespid&aelig; Polistes</i>, <i>Eumenes</i>, and <i>Odynerus</i>,
and for stings are not to be equalled.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wasps!&#8221; cried Jerry, as he swung and swatted
at some still buzzing around him. &#8220;What in the
world did you expect to do with them, Professor
Snodgrass? And why did you have them in the
black box?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I had them to show to one of the headquarters
officers,&#8221; was the answer. &#8220;But I think I
had better postpone the explanation until we get
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_214' name='page_214'></a>214</span>
rid of our pursuers. Let&#8217;s go under those bushes.
I think we shall be safe then,&#8221; and the professor
unceremoniously dived under a clump of shrubbery,
an example followed by Jerry and some of
the others.</p>
<p>Ned and Bob, who had managed to accompany
the professor and their tall chum, were stung several
times before they, also, found shelter beneath
the thick leaves, and howls of pain from a number
of soldiers indicated that they, too, felt the stings
of the insects.</p>
<p>For a while there was as bad a rout of the headquarters
staff as if the Germans had overwhelmed
it. But finally the insects were dispersed, most of
them flying off to the woods, while those that remained
were beaten off, so that the officers and
men began to drift back again. The professor
and the Motor Boys came out of hiding, and then
curious looks began to be cast at the scientist and
the black box, which was now empty. The displaced
cover showed how the wasps had gotten
out.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is this the new weapon for causing a German
retreat that you promised to show me?&#8221; asked
the colonel of the professor, trying not to smile as
he put the question.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; answered Professor Snodgrass, &#8220;it is.
I am sorry, but I am afraid there are no specimens
left to show you. Some one must have tampered
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_215' name='page_215'></a>215</span>
with the fastening of the case, and the insects came
out.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I can offer personal testimony that they came
out,&#8221; said the colonel, trying not to squirm.
&#8220;They came, they saw, and they conquered. And
all I have to say is that I thank you for your interest
in the matter, but that we shall have to decline
to add your new and very efficient, but uncontrollable,
weapon to the Allied armament.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Does that mean you can&#8217;t use the wasps?&#8221;
asked the professor.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid it does,&#8221; said the colonel. &#8220;You
see they are too uncertain&mdash;like the poison gas the
Germans first used. It came back on them. The
wasps might do that to us.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; agreed the little scientist, &#8220;they might.&#8221;</p>
<p>And then, as the last of the insects disappeared,
and the headquarters staff came back from various
places of refuge, Professor Snodgrass explained.</p>
<p>He had long wanted to do something to help
the Allied cause, and thought perhaps it might be
along the line of his studies of insects. Then the
idea of wasps had come to him. He knew the
vicious nature of the insects, and how fearlessly
they would attack anything in their way. It was
his idea that many thousands of the wasps might
be propagated in artificial nests and loosed on the
German armies preceding an attack by the Allies.
The wasps would certainly cause disorder, if not
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_216' name='page_216'></a>216</span>
a rout, he thought, and so he had communicated
his idea to his friend, the colonel.</p>
<p>That is, he had communicated the fact that he
had the idea, but he had not disclosed the nature
of the &#8220;new weapon,&#8221; as he called it in a note.
Always willing to test anything new, the colonel
had sent for the professor, inviting him to bring
a model of the &#8220;new weapon&#8221; with him. The
officer supposed the &#8220;weapon&#8221; might be a gun,
projectile or powder.</p>
<p>&#8220;The idea was a good one in theory,&#8221; said
Jerry, as he and his chums went back with the professor,
who carried the now empty black box.</p>
<p>&#8220;And it worked out all right in practice,&#8221; declared
Ned. &#8220;I never saw a quicker retreat.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The only thing that spoils it, as the colonel
said,&#8221; added Bob, &#8220;is the inability of a wasp to
distinguish between a friend and a foe. If they
could be trained, now&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll delegate that to you,&#8221; put in Ned.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, thanks! I&#8217;m stung badly enough as it
is.&#8221;</p>
<p>And the professor, sadly shaking his head over
the failure of his scheme, went back to work further
on his plan of making moving pictures of insects
hopping about under the stimulus of the
noise of big guns.</p>
<p>But for many a day the story of the wasps at
headquarters was told up and down the firing line.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_217' name='page_217'></a>217</span></p>
<p>It was about a week after this, when preparations
for the big attack had almost reached completion,
that the three chums, having an hour or
so to spare, thought to call on Professor Snodgrass.
They went to the little house in the French
village where he had been staying, and inquired
for him.</p>
<p>&#8220;He has disappeared, Messieurs,&#8221; answered
the old woman who looked after the place.</p>
<p>&#8220;Disappeared!&#8221; echoed the boys blankly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, Messieurs. He went out yesterday
morning without his hat to chase after a butterfly
he saw in the garden, and he did not come back.
He has disappeared. I am sorry, for he was a
nice man, though a trifle queer at times.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, what do you know about that?&#8221; gasped
Jerry, while his chums looked at him in wondering
amazement.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVII</h2>
<h3>ST. MIHIEL</h3>
</div>
<p>&#8220;What are we going to do?&#8221; asked Bob.</p>
<p>&#8220;What can we do?&#8221; Ned returned.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s go after him and bring him back!&#8221; exclaimed
the excitable Bob. &#8220;Maybe the Germans
have him!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then we&#8217;ll not easily get him,&#8221; said Jerry.
&#8220;And, as a matter of fact, we can&#8217;t even try.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why not?&#8221; asked Ned.</p>
<p>&#8220;Because we can&#8217;t leave. All furloughs have
been stopped these last three days. We may go
into action any minute. If the professor is in
trouble we can&#8217;t help him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That seems hard,&#8221; murmured Bob.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is,&#8221; agreed Jerry. &#8220;But it&#8217;s the fortune of
war. We&#8217;re here to fight, and we&#8217;ve got to do
that when the time comes. It may be that the
professor has only wandered off among our own
soldiers, or those of the French or English, after
a butterfly or some other bug.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But without his hat!&#8221; exclaimed Bob.</p>
<p>&#8220;And gone more than a day!&#8221; added Ned.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_219' name='page_219'></a>219</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Those things wouldn&#8217;t worry him,&#8221; said Jerry.
&#8220;Half the time he forgets his hat, and it is midsummer
now. As for being gone more than a
day, he&#8217;s often spent longer than that chasing a
single flea. He is used to camping out, and he&#8217;ll
get along somehow. We&#8217;ll just have to let him
go, that&#8217;s all.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose so,&#8221; agreed Ned; &#8220;but it&#8217;s too bad.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was, but there was nothing they could do.
The professor might wander into the enemy&#8217;s territory
and be captured, or he might come safely
back to the little French village.</p>
<p>&#8220;Though if he doesn&#8217;t come back what are we
to do with his things and about Professor Petersen&#8217;s
nieces?&#8221; asked Ned.</p>
<p>&#8220;The best we can,&#8221; advised Jerry.</p>
<p>&#8220;After the war, if we&#8217;re alive, we can look for
the girls,&#8221; suggested Bob.</p>
<p>&#8220;Pretty slim chance of finding &#8217;em,&#8221; murmured
Ned.</p>
<p>&#8220;It wouldn&#8217;t do much good, anyway, if we can&#8217;t
find the professor. The money was not left to us
to divide,&#8221; was Jerry&#8217;s comment.</p>
<p>Jerry had spoken truly when he said that all
leave had been stopped, for now were beginning
the final great assaults of the American and Allied
armies that were, if not actually to overwhelm the
Huns, at least to approach so nearly that state
that there was a distinction without a difference.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_220' name='page_220'></a>220</span></p>
<p>And it was well that Ned, Bob, and Jerry returned
to their station when they did, for not ten
minutes later the general order to move forward
was given up and down the long line.</p>
<p>&#8220;Forward!&#8221; was the battle cry&mdash;the watchword
that was to guide them all. &#8220;Forward!&#8221;</p>
<p>Forward they went, against Germany&#8217;s best
troops. Forward against a relentless and almost
impregnable foe. Forward in the name of Humanity,
Freedom, and Right. Forward all!</p>
<p>And as Ned, Bob, and Jerry marched with their
comrades up to the firing lines there began that
great movement of American troops which took
part in the reduction of the St. Mihiel salient&mdash;the
wiping out of the great wedge the Germans
had driven into France. And with the wiping out
of this there began the final battle&mdash;the cleaning
of the Argonne Forest which brought an end to
the war.</p>
<p>For some time General Pershing and his general
staff had looked forward to the reduction of
the St. Mihiel salient. With that out of the way
it meant the concentration of the American divisions
in their own zone.</p>
<p>Late in August the line, beginning at Port sur
Seille, east of the Moselle, and extending to the
west through St. Mihiel, thence north to a point
opposite Verdun, was placed under the supervision
of the American commander. Later the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_221' name='page_221'></a>221</span>
American sector was extended across the Meuse
to the western edge of the Argonne Forest, and
included the Second Colonial French, which held
the point of the salient and the Seventeenth
French Corps, which occupied the heights above
Verdun.</p>
<p>As Ned, Bob, and Jerry marched on with their
comrades they saw, or became aware of, the immensity
of the preparations needed to make this
movement a success. For they had to move
against a German position second to none in
strength. To quote General Pershing:</p>
<p>&#8220;The preparation for a complicated operation
against the formidable defenses in front of us included
the assembling of divisions and of corps
of army artillery, transport, aircraft, tanks, ambulances,
the location of hospitals, and the molding
together of all of the elements of a great
modern army with its own railheads, supplied directly
by our own Service of Supply. The concentration
for this operation, which was to be a
surprise, involved the movement, mostly at night,
of approximately 600,000 troops, and required
for its success the most careful attention to every
detail.</p>
<p>&#8220;The French were generous in giving us assistance
in corps and army artillery, with its personnel,
and we were confident from the start of
our superiority over the enemy in guns of all calibers.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_222' name='page_222'></a>222</span>
Our heavy guns were able to reach Metz
and to interfere seriously with German rail movements.
The French Independent Air Force was
placed under my command which, together with
the British bombing squadrons and our air forces,
gave us the largest assembly of aviation that had
ever been engaged in one operation on the western
front.&#8221;</p>
<p>It must not be imagined that all this great army
went forward in a day or two, or that the battle
lasted but a short time. On the other hand, it
was a fight, tooth and nail, for almost every foot
of the way. The battle line from Les Esparages,
around the nose of the St. Mihiel salient to the
Moselle River was about forty miles, and was
greatly strengthened by artificial defenses. This
gives some idea of the task ahead of General
Pershing. If you will picture to yourself a distance
from your own home, as you sit reading
this, to some point distant forty miles, in the
woods or mountains, and then figure this forty
miles occupied by advancing troops, fighting
against a ruthless foe, you will have some idea of
the battle of St. Mihiel.</p>
<p>And it was forward into this battle that Ned,
Bob, and Jerry and their comrades moved. It
would be impossible to tell all that happened&mdash;of
the surging forward into the face of devastating
fire; of the men who fell at the sides of the chums,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_223' name='page_223'></a>223</span>
killed or desperately wounded; of the terrible and
awful sights they saw. For days they fought on.
Gaining ground here, losing, perhaps, a little
there, hiding all night in rain-filled shell-holes,
being driven out, but going back to recapture them
again. On and on they went.</p>
<p>They were weary to death, but they kept on,
and, for a wonder, such is sometimes the fortune
of war, neither Ned, Bob, nor Jerry was seriously
wounded. They received minor knocks, scratches,
and bruises, and once Bob&#8217;s cheek was grazed by
a bullet. But they did not have to drop out of
the fighting.</p>
<p>And it was fierce! No other word describes it.
They fought, and fought, and fought again, onward,
ever onward. For they must not stop. The
American army did not know that word.</p>
<p>And then, after nearly two weeks of steady
fighting, with only such rest for the exhausted
troops as was absolutely necessary, came the final
stage. Ned, Bob, and Jerry, staggering from
weariness, took their places in line one gray morning.</p>
<p>Suddenly about them thundered great salvos
of firing. It shook the very ground. The chums
looked at one another in wonder.</p>
<p>&#8220;This must be another big show,&#8221; shouted
Jerry. He had to shout to be heard above the
noise.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_224' name='page_224'></a>224</span></p>
<p>&#8220;It is,&#8221; said Ned.</p>
<p>And it was. It was the final assault against the
last of the German defenses in St. Mihiel.</p>
<p>&#8220;Forward!&#8221; came the cry, given after four
hours of the greatest artillery barrage ever laid
down. At five o&#8217;clock, on the morning of September
12th, seven American divisions in the front
line advanced. They were assisted by tanks,
manned by Americans and French, and there were
groups of wire-cutters and other groups armed
with bangalore torpedoes. &#8220;These,&#8221; says General
Pershing, in his report, &#8220;went through the
successive bands of barbed wire that protected the
enemy&#8217;s front line and support trenches, in irresistable
waves on schedule time, breaking down
all defenses of an enemy demoralized by the great
volume of our artillery fire, and our sudden approach
out of the fog.&#8221;</p>
<p>And forward, in their own modest and humble
way, with this great army of liberation went Ned,
Bob, and Jerry. Shooting and being shot at they
went forward until the iron strength of the foe
was broken, and the cry sounded:</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re running away! We&#8217;ve got &#8217;em beat!&#8221;</p>
<p>And thus it was. German troops were giving
way in a rout. Let General Pershing tell it in his
own simple way:</p>
<p>&#8220;Our 1st Corps advanced to Thiacourt, while
our 4th Corps curved back to the southwest
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_225' name='page_225'></a>225</span>
through Nonsard. The 2d Colonial French
Corps made the slight advance required of it on
very difficult ground, and the 5th Corps took its
three ridges and repulsed a counter-attack. A
rapid march brought reserve regiments of a division
of the 5th Corps into Vigneulles in the early
morning, where it linked up with patrols of our
4th Corps, closing the salient and forming a new
line west of Thiacourt to Vigneulles and beyond
Fresnes-en-Woevre. At the cost of only 7,000
casualties, mostly light, we had taken 16,000 prisoners
and 443 guns, a great quantity of material,
released the inhabitants of many villages from
enemy domination, and established our lines in a
position to threaten Metz. This signal success
of the American First Army in its first offensive
was of prime importance. The Allies found they
had a formidable army to aid them, and the enemy
learned finally that he had one to reckon with.&#8221;</p>
<p>And that was the battle of St. Mihiel.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVIII</h2>
<h3>IN ARGONNE FOREST</h3>
</div>
<p>&#8220;Well, I reckon we get a rest now, don&#8217;t we?&#8221;
asked Bob of his two chums, as they were ordered
to report to a certain point with others of their
command.</p>
<p>&#8220;A rest?&#8221; cried Ned. &#8220;Say, Chunky, I&#8217;m going
to take a leaf out of your book and wish for
something to eat.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess we&#8217;ll get that, but I doubt if we get
much rest,&#8221; put in Jerry Hopkins. &#8220;I can smell
something cooking, but I don&#8217;t see &#8217;em getting any
beds ready for us.&#8221;</p>
<p>And Jerry proved a true prophet, for there was
refreshment for the battle-worn troops&mdash;hot food
which they very much needed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Have we got to fight some more?&#8221; asked Bob,
as he ate his rations with every indication of appetite.</p>
<p>&#8220;I should say so!&#8221; cried Jerry. &#8220;Why, we&#8217;ve
got to take the Argonne Forest yet, and that&#8217;s
going to be worse than this.&#8221;</p>
<p>And it was.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_227' name='page_227'></a>227</span></p>
<p>Without giving his divisions a rest, which he
dared not do, General Pershing, on the day after
the capture of St. Mihiel, sent some of them toward
the area back of the line between the Meuse
River and the western edge of the Forest of Argonne.
Though the fighting to gain St. Mihiel
had been terrific, with this out of the way the German
line was still intact from Switzerland to the
east of Rheims. The general attack, all along this
line, was with the hope of cutting it, and the part
assigned to the American armies was, as the hinge
of the Allied offensive, directed toward important
railway communications of the German armies
through Mezieres and Sedan.</p>
<p>Knowing that the Germans realized what it
would mean to them to lose the Argonne Forest,
General Pershing and his staff made every preparation
for success. To this end as much secrecy
as possible marked the advance of the Americans.</p>
<p>Says General Pershing:</p>
<p>&#8220;We expected to draw the best German divisions
to our front, and to consume them, while the
enemy was held under grave apprehension lest our
attack should break his line, which it was our firm
purpose to do.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ringing words that will go down in history to
the honor of America!</p>
<p>And with this advance, fighting as they went,
Ned, Bob, and Jerry, and thousands of their brave
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_228' name='page_228'></a>228</span>
comrades, dashed forward into what was to be
one of the bloodiest and most desperate engagements
of the war. To let General Pershing tell
the story in part, by quoting again from his wonderful
report:</p>
<p>&#8220;On the night of September 25th our troops
quietly took the place of the French who thinly
held the line in this sector, which had long been
inactive. In the attack which began on the
26th we drove through the barbed-wire entanglements
and the sea of shell craters across No
Man&#8217;s Land, mastering all the first-line defenses.
Continuing on the 27th and 28th, against machine
guns and artillery of an increasing number
of enemy reserve divisions, we penetrated
to a depth of from three to seven miles and took
the village of Montfaucon and its commanding
hill and Exermont, Gercourt, Cuisy, Septsarges,
Malancourt, Ivoiry, Epinonville, Charpentry,
Very, and other villages. East of the Meuse one
of our divisions, which was with the 2d Colonial
French Corps, captured Marcheville and Rieville,
giving further protection to the flank of our main
body. We had taken 10,000 prisoners, we had
gained our point of forcing the battle into the
open, and were prepared for the enemy&#8217;s reaction,
which was bound to come, as he had good roads
and ample railroad facilities for bringing up his
artillery and reserves.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_229' name='page_229'></a>229</span></p>
<p>&#8220;In the chill rain of dark nights our engineers
had to build new roads across spongy, shell-torn
areas, repair broken roads beyond No Man&#8217;s
Land, and build bridges. Our gunners, with no
thought of sleep, put their shoulders to wheels and
drag-ropes to bring their guns through the mire
in support of the infantry, now under the increasing
fire of the enemy&#8217;s artillery. Our attack had
taken the enemy by surprise, but, quickly recovering
himself, he began to fire counter-attacks in
strong force, supported by heavy bombardments,
with large quantities of gas. From September
28th until October 4th we maintained the offensive
against patches of woods defended by snipers
and continuous lines of machine guns, and pushed
forward our guns and transport, seizing strategical
points in preparation for further attacks.&#8221;</p>
<p>And Ned, Bob, and Jerry had an honorable if
humble part in all this. Forward they fought their
way, now falling back as some fierce German resistance
turned into a counter-attack and again
rushing on to capture some little wooded knoll or
hold some group of trees after the Hun machine
gunners had been killed.</p>
<p>That was the worst of the fighting&mdash;against the
machine guns. They were almost as thick as
leaves in this Argonne Forest and the woods offered
excellent protection to the enemy.</p>
<p>But it was fight, if not exactly in the open, more
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_230' name='page_230'></a>230</span>
nearly so than battles of the trenches, which the
Americans hated. It was like being on their own
ground, for, though the forest was in France, the
trees and bushes were like those in any dense
American woods.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s like being with the professor on some bug-hunting
trip!&#8221; yelled Bob, as he and his chums
rushed on, firing as they went.</p>
<p>&#8220;Except it isn&#8217;t so healthy,&#8221; added Jerry.
&#8220;Look out!&#8221; he shouted, and he pulled Bob down
into the underbrush beside him only just in time,
for there came a burst of bullets from a machine
gun, concealed in a clump of trees, and but for
Jerry&#8217;s timely act when he saw it, Bob might have
been killed.</p>
<p>Then, with a yell, a company of Americans,
with Ned, Bob, and Jerry aiding them, rushed on
the Hun nest and wiped it out, turning the machine
gun on the gray troops about them.</p>
<p>So the fighting went on, bitterly and terribly,
as it had been going on for over a month, for this
was now the beginning of October.</p>
<p>There came a lull in the conflict in the immediate
neighborhood of the Motor Boys. They sank
down exhausted on the ground under the trees,
waiting for further commands, for an officer had
ordered a halt.</p>
<p>As the captain of the company to which Ned,
Bob, and Jerry had been assigned was approaching
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_231' name='page_231'></a>231</span>
to gather his men together, a runner came
along a scarcely defined path.</p>
<p>He saluted the captain, and talked to him for
a moment. Jerry, who was nearest his commander,
saw a queer look on the latter&#8217;s face.
Then, as the runner, with his message disappeared
into the depths of the forest, the captain turned
to his lieutenant, and our heroes heard him say:</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re cut off!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Cut off?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, our battalion and another is surrounded
here in the Argonne Forest. There are Germans
all around us. We&#8217;re cut off. A runner has just
gone to see if he can get through and summon
help.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Surrounded!&#8221; was the thought that came to
all who heard. &#8220;Surrounded by the Germans!
Cut off!&#8221;</p>
<p>And then, almost as soon as that thought
formed came another.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll hold out until help comes or fight our
way through!&#8221;</p>
<p>And then began the tragic story of the &#8220;Lost
Battalions.&#8221;</p>
<hr class='major' />
<div style='margin: auto; text-align: center; padding-top: 2em; padding-bottom: 1em'>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIX</h2>
<h3>CAPTURED</h3>
</div>
<p>Just how or why the two battalions became lost
and surrounded in the Argonne Forest probably
no one will ever know. It was probably a case
of the commands rushing on irresistibly to get as
far as possible into the fore of the fight, and in
going too far through over-zealousness. Or there
may have been misunderstandings, which would
not be uncommon in such a great battle.</p>
<p>However it was, two American battalions were
cut off from their supporting friends, and surrounded
by the Germans who, after having been
driven out of the woods at a certain point, stormed
back and closed the gap through which the two
battalions had gone. Thus they were held at the
mercy of the Huns.</p>
<p>But, as has been said, there was only one
thought in the minds of all&mdash;or rather, two. To
fight their way back and establish communication
with their comrades if possible, or to stand off the
attacking Germans until help came.</p>
<p>And then began a terrible time that lasted from
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_233' name='page_233'></a>233</span>
October 2d to October 8th&mdash;a week of terror,
death and anguish. But the brave Americans bore
it all with fortitude. They had no thought of
surrender even when their food gave out and their
ammunition was reduced to the last few rounds.</p>
<p>Once it was certain that the two battalions were
surrounded by the Germans in the thick woods, a
plan of defense was laid out. The commanding
officers held a consultation and outlined what they
hoped to do. Sending runners for help was one
of these. But this plan did not succeed. Most
of the runners were either killed or captured.
Some may have gotten through, wounded, but for
some time it was impossible for the relieving army
to locate their lost comrades. Efforts were made
to find them by means of aeroplanes flying over
the woods, but the growth of trees and bushes
was so dense that no observations could be made.</p>
<p>And, all this while, the Germans were firing
steadily at the brave men whom they had surrounded
in a ring of steel. Mortars and machine
guns poured a storm of shot and bullets on them,
but the Americans replied in kind, killing and being
killed. For terrible toll was taken by the
Huns, who had the advantage.</p>
<p>Ned, Bob, and Jerry did their duty as it came
to them, as their companions did. Once Jerry,
volunteering as a runner from one position to
another, to take the place of a man killed, came
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_234' name='page_234'></a>234</span>
to a lonely spot in the forest and as he advanced
he heard the shrill whine of a bullet near him.</p>
<p>Instinctively he felt where it came from, and
thought he had located the German sniper. Dropping
into a pile of leaves, as though shot, Jerry
watched from under his cap. He saw a Hun cautiously
raise his head from behind a distant stump,
and that was the last act on the part of that particular
German.</p>
<p>Jerry fired from his pistol, prone as he lay, and
the shot went true. Then the tall lad resumed his
journey, delivered the message and brought back
the answer.</p>
<p>The days and nights of terror passed slowly.
There was engagement after engagement. Time
after time the Americans tried to break through,
but were driven back with terrific loss. But the
Germans could not approach close enough to wipe
them out. Always when the Huns stormed there
was such a withering fire from the American guns
that the Kaiser&#8217;s troops fled back to the fastness
of the woods.</p>
<p>Then came the sending, under a flag of truce,
of the German commander&#8217;s invitation to surrender.
He asked the American commander to
give up, to save useless bloodshed, and said the
Americans taken prisoner would be well treated.</p>
<p>The American commander sent back an answer
which rang with defiance.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_235' name='page_235'></a>235</span></p>
<p>And the fighting went on.</p>
<p>It was awful! The food dwindled away as did
the ammunition. But still the surrounded battalions&mdash;now
less than half their original strength&mdash;would
not surrender.</p>
<p>&#8220;What will be the outcome?&#8221; asked Bob wearily,
as he and his chums, hidden in a shell hole,
held their part of the line.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll win! That&#8217;s what will be the outcome!&#8221;
cried Jerry fiercely. &#8220;We&#8217;ll show the Huns how
we fight!&#8221;</p>
<p>There came a terrific burst of firing, and a hail
of bullets swept over their heads.</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re coming on again!&#8221; yelled Ned.</p>
<p>The firing increased, but it did not seem to approach
nearer. Instead, it appeared to be going
away.</p>
<p>&#8220;What can it mean?&#8221; asked Jerry.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s heavy fighting going on over there,&#8221;
and Ned indicated a point in the forest where it
was known the Germans were in strong force.</p>
<p>There was activity among those that were left
of the two battalions. Last desperate efforts had
been made to send runners through the enemy
line to regimental headquarters to summon help,
but all had been killed or captured. It seemed the
end of everything, when this new and heavy firing
was heard.</p>
<p>And then, like a drink of cold water to a fever-dying
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_236' name='page_236'></a>236</span>
man, a ringing American cheer came
through the woods to the ears of the exhausted
ones.</p>
<p>&#8220;What is it? What is it?&#8221; cried Bob. &#8220;What
does it mean?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It means we&#8217;re rescued!&#8221; shouted Jerry,
jumping up and swinging his cap, disregarding
possible German snipers. &#8220;It means the relief has
come through!&#8221;</p>
<p>The lost battalions were found, the Germans
holding them in the forest were killed or driven
away, and the remainder of the men were saved.</p>
<p>So ended one of the most dramatic episodes of
the war, the losing and finding of these brave men
who would not surrender, but preferred death
first.</p>
<p>On came the relieving army, and there was rest
and food and sleep for the beleaguered ones&mdash;and
of it all perhaps they needed sleep most, for
they had not dared to rest much during that terrible
week.</p>
<p>&#8220;But it will be something to tell the folks back
home,&#8221; said Bob, as the three chums sat down
together, able to eat and talk without the fear of
a German bullet or shell.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, if we ever get there,&#8221; admitted Ned.</p>
<p>&#8220;And, all this while, we haven&#8217;t heard a word
from the professor,&#8221; said Jerry. &#8220;I&#8217;m worried
about him.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_237' name='page_237'></a>237</span></p>
<p>So were his chums, and if they could have seen
their friend at that moment their anxiety would
have been justified.</p>
<p>For briefly to chronicle the adventures that befell
the little scientist: The morning he had wandered
from his temporary French boarding place
without his hat, he really had gone in pursuit of a
strange and rare butterfly.</p>
<p>Then, as so often happened, he became so engrossed
in his scientific work that he forgot all
about everything else, and, before he knew it, he
was miles away from home&mdash;or what passed for
home in those days.</p>
<p>It was late afternoon when Professor Snodgrass
finally captured the butterfly which had
eluded him so long, and put it carefully away in
a pocket case. Then he began to think about
getting back. His stomach told him it was long
past his dinner hour.</p>
<p>Just how it happened he never knew, and probably
it would never happen again, but he managed
to wander across No Man&#8217;s Land at a place secluded,
and thinly guarded, and found himself
behind the German lines.</p>
<p>Professor Snodgrass was not aware of this.
He saw only that he was approaching a small
French village down a pleasant valley, so far
away from the immediate theater of war that the
distant guns made but a dull rumble.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_238' name='page_238'></a>238</span></p>
<p>At first the little scientist thought it was his
own humble village he was coming to, and it was
not until he saw some German soldiers about, and
noted the queer looks on the faces of the French
inhabitants, that he realized his mistake.</p>
<p>As it happened, the big American attack was in
progress, and every available soldier was being
rushed to the front, the few remaining in this village
being among the number. They were preparing
to leave.</p>
<p>So that, in their haste to obey orders and get
to their firing line, or perhaps because they were
too busy to notice one lone little American scientist,
no attention was paid to Professor Snodgrass.</p>
<p>When he saw that he was in an unfamiliar village
and began to ask questions, he was met with
astonished looks, perhaps as much at his peculiar
way of speaking French as anything else. But
one Frenchman said:</p>
<p>&#8220;How did you, an American, manage to get
through?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; answered the professor. &#8220;But
now I want to get back.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Impossible, Monsieur. But come, I will hide
you, if I can. I have some fellow countrymen of
yours at my house, or rather, some fellow countrywomen.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Americans?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, two young ladies. They were left behind
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_239' name='page_239'></a>239</span>
by a certain German, by name of Louder or
Chowder&mdash;name of a name&mdash;and I looked after
them. They will be glad to see you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, dear!&#8221; said the professor. &#8220;Ladies&mdash;American
ladies&mdash;here in this terrible place! I
must do what I can for them. Take me to them,
please.&#8221;</p>
<p>And the Frenchman did so, with all the caution
he could use. But it was not needed. Events
were transpiring that made the Germans think of
beginning a retreat instead of capturing one lone
United States college professor.</p>
<p>&#8220;Here!&#8221; exclaimed the Frenchman, as he ushered
his new friend into his humble home. &#8220;Here
are the ladies. I have brought you a fellow countryman,&#8221;
he added, nodding to his guests.</p>
<p>Two girls, whose pretty faces bore worried
looks, arose to confront Professor Snodgrass.
He bowed, rather flustered as he always was in
the presence of women, and then, as he looked intently
at the girls, a strange look came over his
face.</p>
<p>&#8220;Excuse me,&#8221; he murmured, as he reached for
something in his pocket. He took a card from an
envelope and, looking at one of his companions,
asked:</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you Gladys Petersen?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am!&#8221; was the surprised answer. &#8220;But
how&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_240' name='page_240'></a>240</span></p>
<p>&#8220;And are you Dorothy Gibbs?&#8221; went on the
little scientist, turning to the other.</p>
<p>&#8220;That is my name, but&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then I have found you,&#8221; said the little man
quietly. &#8220;My name is Snodgrass, and I have a
letter to you from your uncle, Professor Emil
Petersen. He leaves you half his fortune and me
the other half. I have been looking everywhere
for you, and now I have found you. But I wish
the boys were here.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What boys?&#8221; asked Miss Petersen.</p>
<p>Without answering this question the professor
explained his errand, and told of his long search
for the girls, to their no small astonishment.
They were shocked to hear of their uncle&#8217;s death,
but they had, long since, given up all hope of ever
sharing in his wealth, even though he had become
reconciled to them after the deaths of their parents.</p>
<p>&#8220;But it is all true,&#8221; said Professor Snodgrass.
&#8220;He wants you to share in his fortune, or rather,
he wanted you to, and I am to carry out his wishes
as expressed in his will. By so doing I get a fortune
for myself. It is really a great relief. But
now tell me&mdash;how did you girls get here? The
last I heard of you was that you were near Metz.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We were there,&#8221; answered Miss Petersen;
&#8220;but the German family with whom we were staying
after uncle went away thought the place in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_241' name='page_241'></a>241</span>
danger of capture and left, taking us with them.
Finally, after traveling about, they said we had
better shift for ourselves, as it was dangerous for
any German to befriend any American, which we
are. So we did what we could. We tried to make
our way to the Allied lines, but this was as far as
we could get. Tell me, Professor, do you think
the Americans will come?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, of course! Yes!&#8221; asserted Professor
Snodgrass, who would have said anything, just
then, to gain time to think, and not to worry the
girls. &#8220;Of course they&#8217;ll be here, but perhaps we
had better go to meet them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yes! Let&#8217;s!&#8221; cried Dorothy. &#8220;Poor
Uncle Emil! If he were only here! He was very
kind to us.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, we loved him,&#8221; added Gladys softly.
&#8220;He was so much like you, Professor Snodgrass&mdash;you
remind me very much of him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am glad I do,&#8221; was the simple answer.
&#8220;Emil Petersen was a man to be proud of. He
was my friend. And now let us consider what is
best to do. I think we had better leave.&#8221;</p>
<p>And so, though only after much protest on the
part of the kind Frenchman, who warned them of
their danger, the three set out. A hat was provided
for Professor Snodgrass. They were going
to try to reach the American lines.</p>
<p>&#8220;I fear you will all be captured,&#8221; said their
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_242' name='page_242'></a>242</span>
host. &#8220;And, if you are, it will go hard with you.
The Germans hate the Americans worse than ever
since the recent defeat of the Kaiser&#8217;s best troops.
I fear you will not get through.&#8221;</p>
<p>And they did not. Just as they seemed on the
point of success, having reached a French village
at a place opposite the Allied line, they were
halted as they were about to cross in a secluded
spot, and during a lull in the fighting.</p>
<p>In his innocence the professor made no effort
to conceal his purpose, and he and the young ladies
were turned back, while a German officer, smiling
in contempt, said:</p>
<p>&#8220;You will do for hostages if the Americans
come too close!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, are they that near?&#8221; cried Dorothy.</p>
<p>&#8220;Too near&mdash;the pigs!&#8221; muttered the officer.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;m so glad!&#8221; cried Gladys. &#8220;Maybe
they&#8217;ll save us after all!&#8221;</p>
<p>But, in spite of her brave words, she looked
worried as she and her cousin were led back. As
for Professor Snodgrass, he bowed his head. He
had failed. Oh, if only the boys had come!</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXX</h2>
<h3>RECAPTURED</h3>
</div>
<p>Once more the desperate fighting was resumed.
Ned, Bob, and Jerry, after a brief rest, were again
thrown into the conflict after their rescue from
the dense Forest of Argonne. That wood had
not yet all been won, but it was in the way of
being. The Germans were fighting their last desperate
battles, and full well they knew it. Only
a miracle could save them now, and there was no
miracle for them.</p>
<p>Not that they did not fight, for they did. The
resistance to the American and Allied advance was
stiff and formidable, but it was overcome, and immense
losses inflicted on the Huns as they made
counter-attack after counter-attack.</p>
<p>It was one day, after some of the most severe
fighting of the war that they had ever seen, that
the battalion, in which Ned, Bob, and Jerry then
were, crossed a little stream, driving the desperately
defending Germans beyond it, and entered
a small French village. When the echo of the
shots had died away, and it was seen that the Huns
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_244' name='page_244'></a>244</span>
were in full retreat, the three chums and their
comrades, at the head of a victorious force,
marched down the main street of the quaint and
ancient little town.</p>
<p>Forth from their hiding places came the French
population, weary and scarred from four years
of enemy occupation. Here and there the tricolor,
so long hidden, waved in the wind. The
hated and dastardly Germans had departed, never,
please God, to come again!</p>
<p>Forward, into the recaptured town, marched
Ned, Bob, Jerry, and their comrades in arms.
With tears in their eyes the French people watched
the Americans come. It was the day so long
prayed for.</p>
<p>Near one of the half-ruined houses, which had
been their abode&mdash;their prison, in fact, since their
capture,&mdash;stood Professor Snodgrass and the two
young ladies.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, can you believe it, Gladys!&#8221; exclaimed
Miss Gibbs. &#8220;It doesn&#8217;t seem possible, does it,
that we are saved?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, but I am beginning to believe that it is
not a dream any more. Those American soldiers
are real, aren&#8217;t they?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They are, indeed, young ladies,&#8221; said the professor.
&#8220;At last I shall be able to go back to my
collection, and finish, I hope, the moving pictures
of insects under the influence of big guns. Oh, I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_245' name='page_245'></a>245</span>
shall also hope to take you to safety with me,&#8221; he
added, as he thought of his wards. &#8220;If only the
boys were here!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What boys do you mean?&#8221; asked Miss Petersen.
&#8220;You have so often spoken of &#8216;the boys,&#8217; but
you have never mentioned who they were.&#8221;</p>
<p>And this was true, for, just as the professor had
been on the point of doing so, he and the girls
had been captured by the Germans, and, since
then, he had not had the heart to speak of his
friends.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I can tell you now,&#8221; he said as he and
the two nieces of Professor Petersen watched the
victorious troops go marching by. &#8220;There are
three boys&mdash;three young men, American soldiers
who&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p>The professor paused, and looked hard at a
certain group of marching Americans. He took
off his glasses, wiped them, and put them on again
to stare with all his power at three youths who
swung along with the <i>sang-froid</i> of veterans.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why!&#8221; exclaimed Professor Snodgrass.
&#8220;Why&mdash;bless my&mdash;bless&mdash;why, it&#8217;s Ned, Bob, and
Jerry themselves!&#8221; he fairly shouted. &#8220;Oh, there
they are! There are the boys themselves!&#8221; and
he rushed forward, tears of joy for the moment
dimming the glasses he had so carefully cleaned
a moment ago.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are the boys. Jerry! Ned! Bob!
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_246' name='page_246'></a>246</span>
Here I am! And here are the girls! Hurrah!
Hurrah for the U. S. A.! Hurrah for President
Wilson! Hurrah for General Pershing! Down
with the Germans! The United States and the
Allies forever! Hurrah!&#8221;</p>
<p>There was a laugh in the ranks of the marching
Americans. Most of them did not catch all
that the little, excited, bald-headed man said, but
they laughed at his enthusiasm and loved him.
But Ned, Bob, and Jerry heard.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s him!&#8221; yelled Bob.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the professor!&#8221; cried Ned.</p>
<p>&#8220;And the girls are with him!&#8221; added Jerry.</p>
<p>The lieutenant of the boys&#8217; company, seeing that
something unusual was in the wind said:</p>
<p>&#8220;You may fall out. Join us later. We&#8217;ll probably
stay here a while. This is our objective, and
we&#8217;ve made it.&#8221;</p>
<p>And then the boys fell out and such a reunion
as there was!</p>
<p>The stories were told and retold, and Ned, Bob,
and Jerry, after having been presented to the
young ladies, listened to their accounts of what
had happened to them since they were caught in
war-torn Europe.</p>
<p>&#8220;And do you think we are safe now?&#8221; asked
Miss Petersen.</p>
<p>&#8220;As safe as in a church,&#8221; declared Bob.
&#8220;We&#8217;ve come to stay!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_247' name='page_247'></a>247</span></p>
<p>And so the Americans had. As General Pershing,
in his report of the operations culminating in
the last phase of the Meuse-Argonne battles, said:</p>
<p>&#8220;The strategical goal which was our highest
hope was gained. We had cut the enemy&#8217;s main
line of communications, and nothing but surrender
or an armistice could save his army from complete
disaster.&#8221;</p>
<p>And the armistice of November 11, 1918, came,
bringing an end to the war.</p>
<p>And it also brings to an end this story. Not
that the fighting was all over, for there was some
after the boys and the professor and his charges
were so happily reunited. But the Motor Boys
had no further part in it. They remained in the
village where they had met the little scientist, as
a guard, until the Germans were so far away as to
render them harmless.</p>
<p>&#8220;And to think you found the girls all by yourself!&#8221;
exclaimed Ned, as they were talking over
the events after the first day of the capture of the
French town.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, yes, I did manage to,&#8221; said the professor,
&#8220;though I never expected, when I started out
for a butterfly that morning, that I&#8217;d end up with
meeting the girls I so much wanted to see.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But we were glad to see you,&#8221; said Miss Gibbs.</p>
<p>&#8220;Very,&#8221; echoed Gladys.</p>
<p>Ned, Bob, and Jerry were very curious to know
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_248' name='page_248'></a>248</span>
what branch of scientific study Miss Petersen and
Miss Gibbs were interested in, for they remembered
that Nick Schmouder had said that they had
left his father&#8217;s home to go further into Germany
for some sort of scientific work. It developed,
however, that Schmouder, ashamed to confess
that, in his fright, he had abandoned the two girls,
had made up the story to clear himself of the
charge of cowardice and neglect.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I guess it&#8217;s all over but the shouting,&#8221;
said Bob, at last. &#8220;And now I guess nobody will
say anything if I eat.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re all with you, Chunky!&#8221; cried Ned. &#8220;I&#8217;m
as hungry as&mdash;as Bob Baker!&#8221;</p>
<p>But of the &#8220;shouting,&#8221; a little must be told.
For when the fighting was over, and it was certain
that Germany could never resume, when the armistice
had been signed and the victorious movement
of the Allies into Germany began, Jerry and his
chums were called one day before their assembled
comrades, and there, much to their surprise, they
were each given honorable mention for their acts
while on duty with the lost battalions in Argonne
Forest. Jerry, for his work as a runner received
the Distinguished Service Cross, and Bob and Ned
honorable mention for their part in the desperate
fight.</p>

<p>&#8220;They ought to decorate Professor Snodgrass
for going alone into the enemy&#8217;s territory and rescuing
two young ladies,&#8221; said Ned, when the
cheering was over.</p>
<p>&#8220;All I want to do is to get back to my bugs,&#8221;
sighed the little scientist, and he soon had his
wish. It might be added that his moving pictures
of insects, showing their actions when heavy guns
were being fired near them, were very successful,
and created a sensation in scientific circles, even
though the professor&#8217;s &#8220;wasp-gun&#8221; was not
adopted.</p>
<p>As soon as it was possible the two young ladies
were sent back to the United States with their
share of their uncle&#8217;s wealth, while Professor
Snodgrass made plans to use his share in making
a full and complete study of the insects of the
Amazon. Also, the boys learned later, Professor
Snodgrass used a part of his fortune to further
assist his old friend, and thus saved the fortunes
of this man and enabled him to pay all his debts,
including the money lent by the professor himself.</p>
<p>&#8220;And now I wonder what will happen to us!&#8221;
exclaimed Bob, when these three friends of theirs
had departed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I fancy we can find something to do,&#8221; said
Jerry. &#8220;I understand the problems of peace will
be as hard to solve as those of war, and we&#8217;ll
have to do our share.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure thing!&#8221; assented Ned.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_250' name='page_250'></a>250</span></p>
<p>What was in store for the boys will be related
in the next volume of this &#8220;Motor Boys&mdash;Second
Series.&#8221; In that we will see how Ned, Bob and
Jerry covered themselves with glory by solving
a most unusual mystery.</p>
<p>A month or so later the three chums, with other
soldiers of the victorious armies, some of them
sorely wounded, were sent to a port in France,
there to take ship for home.</p>
<p>&#8220;And believe me!&#8221; exclaimed Bob, with feeling,
as he went on board, &#8220;France and Europe may be
all right, and so are those Salvation Army doughnuts,
but give me a piece of mother&#8217;s cherry pie!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So say we all of us!&#8221; chanted Ned and Jerry.</p>
<p>And then, as they stood together on deck, the
transport began her homeward trip.</p>
